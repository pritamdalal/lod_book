# Basic Results

In this section I introduce basic concepts and results from quantitative finance that will be needed later in the book.  For a more detailed treatment, I recommend the following execellent texts:

**Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives** by John C. Hull

**Derivative Markets** by Robert L. McDonald


## Arbitrage
An *arbitrage* is a risk-less profit that requires no initial investment.  A basic tenets of finance is that arbitrage opportunities should not exist in the markets.  The reason goes, if there an arbitrage exists, market participants will pile onto the trade and thus move prices until the arb no longer exists.

Mathematically minded nerds with lots of time on their hands use arbitrage related arguments to prove theorem about the nature of markets.  In doing so, they tend to stylized and somewhat questionable assumptions about markets, glossing over certain details to make their mathematical stories work.  Abitrage arguments are highly academic in nature, and plenty of that work is of limited importance to finance practitioners (or anyone for that matter).  

There is, however, a strong kernel of truth to these arguement.  If markets signficantly breach so-called **no arbitrage** prices, then there will be very safe and profitable trades in the market.  Traders will eventually catch on to the these trades, which will cause prices to move toward the no-arbitrage levels.

Keep your eyes peeled for arbs in the market.  And if you find one, please call me.

I am going to present some arbitrage arguments in this chapter.  This is in part because I'm a recovering quantitative finance nerd, and writing this book is something of a relapse for me. It's also because I occassionally get questions from students that requires resorting to arbitrage arguments.  Out of of a genuine interest for their well beings, I try to let the know that getting caught up such details is a frivolous waste of time.  And even though it pains me to contribute to their pathology by ingulging in such pedantry, I figure they have paid tuition so I probably owe them an answer.

I envy those of you who can take the statements of fact in this chapter as given, and then simply move on to more elevated pursuits. 

## Stocks & Dividends

Companies can raise funds to grow their business by issuing *shares of stock*. The buyer of the stock - often called a shareholder - pays money to the comapany which the company keeps forever.  In return, the shareholder is entitled to a fraction of the companies future profits and also has the ability to vote on certain matters at shareholder meetings. A crucial point is that the owner of a stock has limited liability with resepct to the company.  The worst thing that can happen is that shareholder never recieves any profits, and the stock itself also becomes worthless.  So, for example, if the company is caught illegally polluting, the shareholder cannot be sued for damages.  In this sense the value of stock can never be negative. 

Once a stock has been issued by a company, the owner of the stock can sell it to another invester.  This is called a secondary market transaction.  Once the share has been sold in the secondary market, the claims to profits and the voting rights are both transfered to the purchaser.

Secondary market transactions occur on exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange, and are usually what people are referring to when they talk about *the stock market*.  These transactions occur via complicated auction mechanisms that match buyers and sellers.  The mechanisms are such that the actual trade prices can fluctuate (sometimes greatly) from transaction to transaction.  

Here are some example of companies who's stocks trade heavily in the secondary markets.

**AAPL** - Apple (you seriously have an Android bro) 

**GOOG** - Alphabet (dude iPhones are totally overrated)

**FB** - Facebook (please like my pictures and make me feel cool)

**XOM** - Exxon Mobile (I'm self-righteous about the environment...until I check my 401K)

Suppose you want to trade a share of stock, and you want to be able to fill your trade immediately.  If you are a buyer of the stock, you will be charged a certain amount called the ask price.  If you are a seller of the stock you will recieve a certain amount called the bid price.  The bid price is lower than the ask price.  These so-called *bid-ask spreads* exist in other financial markets as well, including options markets.

If you are a market for a particular stock, there are three prices that you will surely need to keep your eye one.  The current bid price, the current ask price, and the last price at which a trade occurred.  We will often refer to *the price of a stock at time* $t$ and denote by $S_{t}$.  We can ofen gloss over what the phrase *the price of the stock* exactly means, you can safely choose to interpret it in one of two way: 1) the current mid price, which is as the average of the bid and ask at time $t$; 2) the last trade price as of time $t$.  For stocks that have high trading volume, these two values will be usually quite close - but this is not always the case. 

The upshot of our previous discussion about exchanges is that $S_{t}$ varies through time.  As it turns out, it is useful to think of the of $S_{t}$ as a series of random variable.  In fancy math circles this is know as a *stochastic process*.  It is my intention to try to avoid the nerdery of fancy math as much as possible, but sometimes we will be forced to indulge is such evils.  My apologies in advanced.

When profits are distributed to the owners of a stock, this is done on a per share basis.  The amount that is paid per share is called a *dividend payment*. It is reasonable to wonder whether issuing a dividend payment has any near-term impact on the price of the stock.  This question leads to our first *qunatitative* result.


**Theorem:** Suppose that a stock is going make a divided payment of $c$ at time $T$ and that just prior to the dividend payment is trading at a price of $S^{*}$.  Then then price of the stock just after the divident payment is $S_{T} = S^{*} - c$.


Properly defining the concept of a share of *stock* is a complicated legal exercise.  Similarly, an accurate description of how stocks are sold in the secondary market would require it's own large (and boring) book.  The amount of detail you will depend on your use-case.  For example, if you are an attorney that works on IPOs, you will need to know a lot about the legal stuff.  If you are a creating statistical arbitrage strategies, you will need be an expert on exchange microstructure.

For the purposes of this book, the following stylized facts will suffice.

1. Stocks give their claims to the companies profits.  This is a limited liability investment in that the value of a stock can never be negative.

2. After their initial issuance, Share of stock can be in the secondary market.

3. Trading of stocks on the secondary market occurs on exchanges, with trades occurring thousands or millions of times a day during business hours.

4. The exchange creates complex auction mechanisms to match buyers and seller. The rules are such that trades can occur and different prices for every transaction.

5. The stream of trade prices is often denoted as $S_{t}$ can be conceptualized as a stochastic process.

6. Profits are paid out to shareholders in the form of a per-share payment called a dividend.  Immediately after the payment of a dividend, the stock price will reduce by the amount of the dividend.


## Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

Investing in stocks and other assets is usually an overly costly and complex proposition for an individual.  For this reason, there are various vehicles for small investors to pool their money, and for it to then be invested under the auspices of invmentment professionals.  The most common for of investment pooling is a mutual fund.  More esoteric manifestations are hedge funds, unit invesment trust (UIT), and real estate investment trusts (REIT). The distinction between these is of general interest, but won't be of huge importance to us in this book.

A fairly recent innovation in the world of pooled invesments is exchange traded funds (ETFs).  Relative to mutual funds and hedge funds, ETFs engage in simpler strategies that are easier to execute.  For this reason, it take fewer people to manage the fund and costs are low.  In additon, sharte of ETFs are traded on exchanges in the exact same way as share of stock.  ETFs also pay dividends in the same way that stocks do.  Here are some popular ETFs:

**SPY** - SPDR SP500 - tracks the S&P500.

**IWM** - iShares Russell 2000.

**GLD** - invests in gold future.

**XLF** - SPDR Financial - tracks the performance of financial services sector. 

For the purpose of this course, we will treat stocks and ETFs as largely the same.

## Discounting & Accumulating

When you lend money, you are paid interest to compensate for the fact that you can't use the money to lent for other purposes. In this book I assume loans are totally safe and there is no risk of default.  It is useful to the of the loan amount accumulating with interest. I use the following notation and nomenclature to capture this idea of accumulation:

**Definition:** Assume the current time is $t$ and that $T$ is some time in the future. Then one dollar will accumulate to $A(t,T)$ by time $T$.  I will call $A(t,T)$ an *accumulation factor*.

If you are going to recieve money in the future, it's not really worth as much to you as if the money were paid right now.  The way we account for this value difference is by essentially *discounting* by the amount of interest you could have earned between now when you are going to be paid. The is the notion of present value and I express it as follows:


**Definition:** The time $t$ present value of a one dollar cashflow at time $T$ will be denoted by $D(t,T)$. I will call $D(t,T)$ a discount factor. I will call $D(t, T)$ a *discount factor*.


The following statements are true:

1. $A(t,T) \geq 1$.

2. $D(t, T) \leq 1$.

3. $D(t,T) = A(t,T)^{-1}$.


**Definition:** Suppose the current time is $t$ and consider a series of cashflows $C_{1}, \ldots, C_{n}$ occurring at future times $t_{1}, \ldots t_{n}$.  Then the time $t$ present value of this stream of cashflows is defined as:

\begin{align*}
PV(\{ C_{1}, \ldots, C_{n} \}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} D(t, t_{i}) \cdot C_{i}.
\end{align*}


#### Forward Accumulating
Suppose that the current time is $t$ and that $T$ is some time in the (distant) future.  Suppose you know at for all $s \in (t, T)$ that all the values of $A(t,t)$. This is set of accumulation factors is known as the spot yield curve (it is usually quoted in rates, but the idea is the same).

Now, suppose for some particular $t^* \in (t, T)$ you want to work out an arrangement with your bank such that you will deposit one dollar at time $t^*$ and let it accumulate until $T$.  What is the accumlation factor that you should earn?  It turns out that this *forward accumulation factor* is determined by the spot yield curve.  We will denote the quantity $A(t, t^*, T)$. There is a simple no-arbitrage argument for this but I won't bother presenting it here becuase it's not import.  All you need to know is that it satisfies the following equation
\begin{align*}
A(t, T) = A(t, t^*) \cdot A(t, t^*, T)
\end{align*}


## Option Contracts

We discussed vanilla (American and European) options at length in the previous section, but I wll 


## Forward Contracts

Forward contracts are simple derivatives that are one of the foundational building blocks in the theory and practice of quantitative finance.  The value of forwards are related to option prices via a result known as *put-call parity*, a finding seminal to much of derivatives theory.

### Specification and Payoff
A forward contract this the obligation to transact some underlying asset at some future date, at a fixed price, called the strike price.  The party that agrees to buy the underlying, is called the *long* side; the party that agrees to sell the underlying is the *short* side.  The underlyings we will consider in this book will be stocks or ETFs, but forwards can exist on any kind of underlying: gold, corn, etc.

The key feature of a forward is that *both* sides are *obligated* to execute their side of the transaction - to either buy our sell the asset, at the agreed upon strike price. This stands in contrast to an option, in which the long side has a right, while the short side has an obligation.

Suppose a forward contract struck at $K$ expires at time $T$.  Suppose that underlying is trading at $S_{T}$ at the time of expiration.  The long side has to pay $K$ and in return receives the underlying which has a value of $S_{T}$.  Thus the long position is worth $S_{T} - K$ at expiration.  On the other hand, the short side recieves $K$ but has to deliver the underlying, which is worth $S_{T}$.  So the short position is worth $K - S_{T}$.

Long Payoff: $S_{T} - K$

Short Payoff: $S_{T} - K$


### The Forward Price
Suppose that the current time is $t$ and that we are considering a forward contract that expires at time $T$.  Suppose further that the underlying is currently trading at $S_{t}$.  We are interested in the following questions: is there strike price of $K$ such that both parties can enter into the forward contract for zero cost, without introducing an arbitrage opportunity for either side?  

It turns out the answer is yes, an this strike price is of such importance that it has been named simply, *the forward price*.  A forward price is determined by two points in time: the current time $t$ and the expiration time $T$. We will denote the forward price associated with these two times as $F(t, T)$.


**Forward Pricing Formula:**  Suppose we are considering a forward contract at time $t$ which expires at time $T$.  Suppose that the underlying is currently trading at $S_{t}$ and that during the life of the forward, the underlying stock pays dividends $c_{1}, \ldots, c_{n}$ at times $t_{1}, \ldots, t_{n}$.  Then the we have that:

\begin{align*}
F(t, T) &= A(t, T) \cdot S_{t} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} A(t, t_{i}, T) \cdot c_{i}
\end{align*}

In words we have that the forward price is the accumulated value of the current stock price less the accumulated value of all the dividend payments during the life of the contract.


Notice that for non-dividend paying stocks we have that: $F(t, T) = A(t, T) \cdot S_{t}$.

### Valuing a Forward Contract
Suppose that you enter into a forward contract at time $t^{*}$ and the strike price $K$ was chosen such that both parties could enter into the contract for zero cost.  Suppose that the time is now $t > t^{*}$, what would be the value to unwind this contract?


**Fact:** The no arbitrage unwind value of this contract is $D(t, T) \cdot (F(t, T) -  K)$.


This result really has nothing to do with the fact that the forward contract entered into at time $t^{*}$ or that it's initial strike what chosen to make it a zero value contract.  Ultimately it just gives us a formula for valuing a forward contract at any point.

Notice that if a forward contract is struck at the current forward price, then it has zero value, which we would expect.


### Synthetic Forwards

A portfolio consisting of a long call and a short put is a synthetic forward position.


Let the current time be $t$.  Consider a call and put on the same underlying, with the same strike price $K$, that both expire at time $T$.  If you have a long position in the call and a short position in the put, then in all states of the world at time $T$ this portfolio has a value of $S_{T} - K$, which is the same value as the payoff as a long forward.

Suppose that $S_{T} > K$. You exercise your long call, for which you recieve the stock worth $S_{T}$ whilie paying the strike price $K$ for it. The put you are short expires worthless. The total value of these two positions is $S_{T} - K$.

On the other hand, suppose $S_{T} < K$. Your short put postion will be exercised, forcing you to buy the stock for $K$ even though it is only worth $S_{T}$.  Your call is worthless, so you won't exercise.  Once again, the combined value of these two position is $S_{T} - K$.

If $S_{T} = K$, nothing happens because both options are worthless. Doing nothing has zero value.  But of course in this situation we have that $S_{T} - K = 0$.


## Put-Call Parity
Let the current time be $t$ and consider a put and a call that both expire at time $T$ and that are both struck at $K$.  From the previous section we know that a long call and a short put create a synthetic forward struck at $K$.  We also know how to value any forward contract.  Putting these two results together we get following put-call parity identity.

\begin{align*}
C(t, T, K) - P(t, T, K) = D(t, T) \cdot (F(t, T) - K)
\end{align*}

Put-call parity is one of the most important and foundational results in all of derivatives theory.  Let's examine a couple special cases more closely.

#### Non-Dividend Paying Stock {-}
Recall that when the stock pays no dividends during the life of the forward, that the forward price is simply the accumulated spot price.  Thus we can 

\begin{align*}
C(t, T, K) - P(t, T, K) &= D(t, T) \cdot (F(t, T) - K) \\
                        &= D(t, T) \cdot (A(t, T) \cdot S_{t} - K) \\
                        &= S_{t} - D(t, T) \cdot K
\end{align*}


#### Dividend Paying Stock {-}
Suppose that during the life of the options, that the underlying stockpays dividends $c_{1}, \ldots, c_{n}$ at times $t_{1}, \ldots, t_{n}$.
\begin{align*}
C(t, T, K) - P(t, T, K) &= D(t, T) \cdot (F(t, T) - K) \\
                        &= D(t, T) \cdot \bigg(A(t, T) \cdot S_{t} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} A(t, t_{i}, T) \cdot c_{i} - K \bigg) \\
                        &= S_{t} - PV(\{c_{1}, \ldots, c_{n} \}) - D(t, T) \cdot K
\end{align*}


## Rational Option Pricing

The Black-Schole pricing framework, which will discuss at lenght in later chapters, requires complex assumptions about the random nature of the underlying, and dynamic trading strategies for replicating option payoffs. These complexities are required a specific value to an option, but there is a actually a lot we can say about option prices in general without making any assumptions of the underlying.


#### Extreme American Bounds {-}
The worst thing that can happen with a put or call is that it is not exercised, which means that they can never be worth less than zero.  For a call, the best thing that can happen is that you exercise, which results in owning the stock, a call can never be worth more than the underlying stock.  For a put, the best outcome is that you exercise when the stock is worthless, and you recieve $K$.  Thus, the put can never be worth more that $K$.  These facts are summarized in the following inequalities

\begin{align*}
0 &\leq C_A(S, K, T) \leq S \\
0 &\leq P_A(S, K, T) \leq K.
\end{align*}


#### Americans $\geq$ European {-}
Any strategy that you can execute with a European option, you can execute with the American variant as well.  Thus we have that
\begin{align*}
C_E(S, K, T) &\geq C_A(S, K, T) \\
P_E(S, K, T) &\geq C_A(S, K, T).
\end{align*}


#### Call Bounds {-}
We can string together put-call parity along with the previous two results (add equation numbers), to arrive at the following series of inequalities:

\begin{align*}
\text{max}\big\{ 0, D(t, T) \cdot ((F(t, T) - K))  \big\} \leq C_E(S, K, T) \leq C_A(S, K, T) \leq S.   
\end{align*}

From left to right the justification for the three inequalities are as follows:

1. Extreme lower bound combined with put-call parity.  Notice that this is equivalent to saying that a vanilla call is always worth greater that intrinsic.

2. Americans are worth more than Europeans.

3. Extreme upper bound for Amerians.


#### Put Bounds {-}
We can argue for a similar sequence of inequalities for puts:

\begin{align*}
\text{max}\big\{ 0, D(t, T) \cdot (K - F(t, T))  \big\} \leq P_E(S, K, T) \leq P_A(S, K, T) \leq K. 
\end{align*}


From left to right the justification for the three inequalities are as follows:

1. Extreme lower bound combined with put-call parity.  Notice that this is equivalent to saying that a vanilla put is always worth greater that intrinsic.

2. Americans are worth more than Europeans.

3. Extreme upper bound for Amerians.


#### Early Exercise No Dividends {-}
It is never optimal to early exercise an American call option on a non-dividend paying stock.  For a non-dividend paying underlying, it is always better to sell the call than to exercise.  To see this, recall that from put call parity we have that

\begin{align*}
C_E(S_t, K T) &= D(t, T) \cdot (F(t, T) - K) + P_E(K, T) \\
            &= D(t, T) \cdot (A(t, T) \cdot S_t - K)) + P_E(S_t, K, T) \\
            &= S_t - D(t, T) \cdot K + P_E(S_t, K, T).
\end{align*}

If we can show that $S_t - D(t, T) \cdot K + P_E(K, T) > S_t - K$ then we are done, because American options are always worth at least as much as Europeans.  This inequality is equivalent to
\begin{align*}
K > D(t, T) \cdot K - P_E(S_t, K, T) \iff
K\cdot(1 - D(t, T)) + P_E(S_t, K, T) > 0
\end{align*}

But of course this final inequality is true because $D(t, T) < 1$ and $P_E(S_t, K, T) > 0$.


#### Early Exercise Single Dividend {-}
(NOT COMPLETE)  Consider and American call on a stock that pays a single dividend, call it $\delta$, before the option expires, say at time $t^*$.  From put-call parity we have
\begin{align*}
C_E(S_t, K, T)  &= D(t, T) \cdot (F(t, T) - K) + P_E(S_t, K, T) \\
                &= D(t, T) \cdot (A(t, T) \cdot S_t - D(t, t^*)\delta - K) + P(S_t, K, t)
                &= S_t - D(t, T) \cdot D(t, t^*) \delta - K \cdot D(t, T) + P(S_t, K, t)
\end{align*}
