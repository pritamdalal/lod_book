["discounting-accumulating.html", "1.1 Discounting &amp; Accumulating", " 1.1 Discounting &amp; Accumulating When you lend money, you are paid interest to compensate for the fact that you can’t use the money to lent for other purposes. In this book I assume loans are totally safe and there is no risk of default. It is useful to the of the loan amount accumulating with interest. I use the following notation and nomenclature to capture this idea of accumulation: Definition: Assume the current time is \\(t\\) and that \\(T\\) is some time in the future. Then one dollar will accumulate to \\(A(t,T)\\) by time \\(T\\). I will call \\(A(t,T)\\) an accumulation factor. If you are going to recieve money in the future, it’s not really worth as much to you as if the money were paid right now. The way we account for this value difference is by essentially discounting by the amount of interest you could have earned between now when you are going to be paid. The is the notion of present value and I express it as follows: Definition: The time \\(t\\) present value of a one dollar cashflow at time \\(T\\) will be denoted by \\(D(t,T)\\). I will call \\(D(t,T)\\) a discount factor. I will call \\(D(t, T)\\) a discount factor. The following statements are true: \\(A(t,T) \\geq 1\\). \\(D(t, T) \\leq 1\\). \\(D(t,T) = A(t,T)^{-1}\\).
