<!-- ## Garrett Grolemund {-} -->

<!-- Garrett Grolemund is the co-author of _R for Data Science_ and author of _Hands-On Programming with R_. He wrote the **lubridate** R package and works for RStudio as an advocate who trains engineers to do data science with R and the Tidyverse. If you use R yourself, you may recognize Garrett from his video courses on Datacamp.com and O'Reilly media, or for his series of popular R cheatsheets distributed by RStudio. -->

<!-- Garrett earned his PhD in Statistics from Rice University in 2012 under the guidance of Hadley Wickham. Before that, he earned a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Harvard University and briefly attended law school. Garrett has been one of the foremost promoters of Shiny, R Markdown, and the Tidyverse, documenting and explaining each in detail. -->
