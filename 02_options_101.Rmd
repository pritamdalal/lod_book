# Options 101

The purpose of the chapter is to introduce the rudiments of options.  I will start intuitive, and introduce formalism as necessary.

Options are simple contracts that show up everywhere in finance.  They can be viewed as the building blocks of many other financial instruments.  The theory of option pricing serves as the foundation of much of quantitative finance.

Options are insurance contracts wrapped around other financial assets.  The asset that is being insured is called the *underlying*.  The underlyings we are going to consider in this book will be stocks and ETFs, but the essential concepts are the same for other underlyings such as interest rates, corn futures, or barrels of oil.

Let's build some intuition by considering a type of insurance that you are probably familiar with: car insurance.


## Car Insurance

Wolverine Trading is a successful market-making firm based in Chicago. Following the lead of billionaire Warren Buffet, who's major cash-cow is GEICO, the partners at Wolverine are interested in getting into the car insurance business. They have hired us as consultants to help devise a pricing policy for this exciting new business venture.


The type of underlying that Wolverine would like to insure is: a specific driver coupled with a specific vehicle.  The driver that is being insured is going to pay Wolverine *premium*.  In exchange for the premium, Wolve will reimburse the driver whenever damage to the car exceeds a certain dollar amount, called the *strike* of the contract.


**Intuition Check:** Do you think that Wolverine should charge the same premium irrespective of the underlying?  Why or why not?

After some deliberation, we have decided that price differentiation should based on the following contract features and underlying characteristics: strike, time to expiration, price of the underlying, volatility of the underlying.

Let's explore these one by one.

#### Price of Underlying {-}

Sandra is a prospective customer; she has two vehicles that she wants to switch over.   One is a busted old Mazda 3 that she bought when she was a struggling graduate student.  The other is a fancy self-driving Tesla she bought after starting her lucrative options trading career.

**Intuition Check:** Which car should be more expensive to insure?  Why?


#### Strike Price of Contract {-}

Wolverine has three different strike prices that they can offer Sandra for her Tesla:

  - \$0 ("at-the-money")
  - \$1,000
  - \$5,000


**Exercise:** Order the premium for the three strike prices from cheapest to most expensive.  Explain your answers.


#### Time to Expiration {-}

Wolve Auto has three different contract tenors they can offer to Sandra for her Tesla:

  - 0.25 years
  - 0.50 years
  - 1.00 years

**Exercise:** Order the premium for the three tenors from cheapest to most expensive.  Explain your answer.


#### Voltility of Underlying {-}

Wolve is pricing insurance for two different customers, Sally and Patty. Both are looking to purchase insurance a fancy new self-driving Tesla.   They both want a 1-year contract with with a $1,000 strike price.  Sally's friends describe her as calm, chill, responsible, quiet, serene.  On the other hand, Patty's friends describe her: wild, hyper, flakey, loud, and volatile.
 
**Intuition Check:** Who should Wolverine charge more for insurance? Why?


#### Insurance Payoff Graph {-}

It's 8 a.m. on a Saturday morning.  Sally is driving on the freeway heading to her Crossfit class: hands at 10-and-2, eyes intently on the road, soothing classical music playing in the background.

Patty is also driving on the freeway, making her way home from an all night rave.  As she drives, she smokes cigarette, touches up her makeup, and then snaps a few selfies for her IG stories (morning car selfies have the *best* light...OMG).

<!-- she has a cigarette in one hand, and with the other she is some snapping some selfies for her IG story - morning car selfies have the *best* light. -->


Suddenly, Patty loses control and swerves in front of Sally. Patty is riding dirty and has no insurance, but responsible Sally a made sure to switch over to a \$1000-strike Wolverine policy.  Here is a graph of the *payoff* to Sally's insurance contract immediately following the accident. (Make sure to type out this code along with me!!)


```{r, sally_insurance_payoff}
strike <- 1000 
damage <- seq(0, 3000, 500)
payoff <- pmax(damage - strike, 0)
heading <- "insurance payoff"
plot(damage, payoff, type = "n", main = "Payoff to Sally")
lines(damage, payoff, type = "l")
```


Notice that if the damage is less than the \$1,000 strike price, Sally recieves no reimbursement from her insurance.  For every dollar over the strike price, Sally recieves a one-for-one payout.  Publicly traded option contracts, which are the subject of this book, behave similarly.


## Vanilla Options

Options come in many different varieties: European, American, Asian, digital, look-back, etc. European and American options are considered the simplest and for that reason they are collectively referred to as *vanilla* options.
All other options are considered more complicated and are therefore referred to as *exotic*.  Vanilla options are transacted in far greater volumes than exotics, and nearly all publicly traded options are vanilla. In this book I focus exclusively on vanillas.


#### American Options as Insurance {-}

American (equity) options are insurance contracts that have as their underlying publicly traded stocks.  They are called *options* because owning them gives you a *right* to do something, but you are **not required** to exercise that right.  You have the *option* exercise if it happens to be beneficial to you.  This *right with out obiligation* has the effect of creating an insurance benefit for the option holder.

American options come in two varieties: puts and calls.  *Put* contracts are insurance for those who already own the stock and intend to sell it in the future; they are protection against the price of the stock falling before they've had a chance to sell it.  *Call* contracts are insurance for those who intend to buy stock in the future; they are protection against the price of the stock rising before they've had a chance to buy it.

In reality, you don't have to purchase either puts or calls as insurance.  You don't have to own the underlying to buy a put.  If you do happen to own the underlying, you don't have to intend to sell it.  Nor do you have to intend to buy the underlying in the future in order to buy calls.  You can buy or sell either types of contracts to express different views on the underlying.


#### American Option Contract Specification {-}

After a lot of hand waving, I'm finally ready to give a proper contract specification for American options.  You are no doubt tingling with anticipation.  Prepare to be let down - things won't get interesting until you complete a couple of years of banal study.

Let's consider American options on some stock $S$.  Puts and calls on $S$ are defined by two additional contract features: *strike price* and *expiration date*.

**Call:** a contract that gives the right, but not the obligation, to **buy** a share of $S$ at the strike price any time before the expiration date.

**Put:** a contract that gives the right, but not the obligation, to **sell** a share of $S$ at the strike price any time before the expiration date.

See, I told you...pretty lame.

#### Option Buyers and Option Sellers {-}

There are two sides to every options transaction.  The *option buyer* pays premium and owns a right.  The *option seller*, on the other hand, receives premium and is obligated to respect the right that the buyer has purchased.

In the case of puts, if the option buyer exercise their right to sell the underlying, the option seller is obligated to buy the underlying from them.  In the case of calls, if the option buyer exercise their right to buy the underlying, the option seller is obligate to sell the underlying to them.

Sentences like those in the previous paragraph can be a little confusing at first.  There are a lot of "buys" and "sells"" floating around. Don't worry, it will get less confusing over time, and at some level you will never get over need to splash some cold water on your face, take a walk around the block, then go back to the definition of puts and calls.


**Exercises:** Ruobing has purchased an American call on SPY with a strike price of \$250.  He paid \$10 in premium.  Farez was the option seller on this transaction.  It's now the final day of the contract and Ruobing has still not exercised his right. 


1. Under what circumstances will Ruobing choose to excericse his right?

1. Under what circumstances does Ruobing make money?

1. Under what circumstances does Farez make money?

1. What are the min and max of Ruobing's PNL (include premium)?

1. What are the min and max of Farez's PNL (include premium)?

1. Answer the same questions for a put with the same strike, expiration, and premium.


#### European vs American {-}

European options are very similar to Americans.  The only difference is that the owner of a European option can only exercise their right immediately after the final trading day of the contract.  Recall that with American the option holder can *early exercise* at any point before expiration.

To summarize: European options have an exercise date (point).  American options have an exercise window - it starts today and ends on expiration.

It turns out that in most cases it is not optimal to early exercise an American option (we will explore these arguments in the following chapter).  For this reason, we will consider American and European the options as being the same (only the most pedantic of quants will take issue with this).

Because there is only one point of time at which a European option can be exercised, the notion of a payoff function is completely straight-forward: it is the value of exercising at the time of expiration.  With American options, the notion of a payoff function is complicated by the possibility of early exerise.  However, we will lean on the fact that it is almost never optimal to early exercise an American options, and also define their payoff function as the value of exercising at the time of expiration.



#### Payoff Function {-}

At this point I will introduce some mathematical notation, as it become more efficient to communicate about options with a bit of notation (but not too much).  

Suppose the current date is $t$ .  Consider a put and call have the same underlying, the same expiration $T > t$, and the same strike price $K$.  Let $S_{T}$ be the price of the stock at expiration.  Let $\pi_{b}$ be the put buyer's payoff, and let $\pi_{c}$ be the call buyer's payoff.  Then we have that:


Put Buyer Payoff: $\pi_{p}(S_{T}) = \max \big \{(K - S_{T}),0 \big \}$

Call Buyer Payoff: $\pi_{c}(S_{T}) = \max \big \{(S_{T} - K), 0 \big \}$


**Exercises:**

1. Convince yourself that the above is true given the contract specification of vanilla puts and call.

1. Graph $\pi_{p}$ and $\pi_{c}$ as a function of $S_{T}$.

1. Write the expressions for seller's payoff of both puts and calls.  Draw the graphs.

1. *Total PNL* takes into account the option premium.  Let $m_{p}$ be the put premium and let $m_{c}$ be the call premium.  Modify all four of your graphs to be total pnl functions, rather than payoff functions.


1. If we consider $\pi_{p}$ and $\pi_{c}$ as functions of $S_T \in (0, +\infty)$, then both functions are differentiable at all points except for $S_T = K$.
    a. What are the two values of $\frac{d\pi_{c}}{dS_{T}}$?
    b. What are the two values of $\frac{d\pi_{p}}{dS_{T}}$?


1. Recall that the current time is $t$ and let $S_{t}$ be the current price of the stock.
    a. If you own the put, which inequality do you hope is true between $S_{t}$ and $S_{T}$.  What ineqality do you hope holds true between between $S_{T}$ and $K$?
    b. If you own the call, which inequality do you hope is true between $S_{t}$ and $S_{T}$? How about between $S_{T}$ and $K$?




## Long vs Short

If you spend time around financial markets you are likely to encounter the jargon terms and "short" and "long".  Only rarely will the speakers be discussing mullets.  These terms can be a bit confusing to the uninitiated, but used in moderation they are a useful shorthand.  In this section I unpack this jargon, as we will make use of it in the rest of the text.


#### Buyers vs Sellers {-}

Let's return to the car insurance industry for a moment.  In any transaction there is a buyer and a seller.  In the car insurance market there are certain classes of entities that buy the insurance, and other classes of entities that sell the insurance.  For example, I have purchased car insurance from State Farm and GEICO (you're welcome Warren).  However, there would never be a situation in which GEICO or State Farm would buy a car insurance policy from me.

Options markets are different in this respect.  Various classes of entities - market-makers, hedge-funds, retail traders - buy options as well as sell options.  For example, on given trading day, I may sell an option which a hedge-fund may buy from me on an exchange.  On the following day, I may buy a different option from that same hedge fund.

Said in a different way, in options market, any particular entity can simultaneously be a buyer of options *and* a seller of options.


#### Net Position {-}

As you saw in earlier exercises, the payoff of the option sell is the negative of the payoff of the option buyer.  So let's associate the number $+1$ with the act of buying an option, and let's associate the number $-1$ with the act of selling an option contract.  More generally, we can associate a *quantity* number $Q$ with an options trade. If $Q>0$ then the trade is to buy $Q$ options.  If $Q < 0$ then the trade is to sell $|Q|$ options.   


**Intuition Check:** What is the payoff function for buying $Q$ options and holding them until they expire?

Suppose a trader named Lewei has engaged in $n$ trades on a particular contract $\mathcal{O}$. And suppose that the quantities of the trades were $Q_{1}, \ldots, Q_{n}$. Liwei's *net position* in the option $\mathcal{O}$ is $Q^{*}$ where
\begin{align*}
Q^{*} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} Q_{i}.
\end{align*}

This concept of net position brings us to our first meanings of *long* and *short*:

**Long:** If $Q^{*}>0$ we say that Lewei is *long* $Q^{*}$ contracts of $\mathcal{O}$.  More generally, we would say that Lewei has a *net long* position in $\mathcal{O}$.

**Short:** If $Q^{*}<0$ we say that Lewei is *short* $|Q^{*}|$ contracts of $\mathcal{O}$.  More generally, we would say that Lewei has a *net short* position in $\mathcal{O}$.

So, we say that you are *long* a contract if you are a net buyer of the contract, and we say you are *short* the contract if you are a net seller of the contract. 

#### Value {-}

The other meanings of long/short has to do with how you depending on the direction of change of the price of an asset.

You are said to be *long* an asset if you make money when the value of that asset goes up.  You are said to be *short* an asset if you make money when the value of that asset goes down.

So for example, if you hold AAPL in your 401(K), then you are long AAPL because the value of your retirement savings increases when Apple's stock price rises.  Similarly, if you have a net short position in a call, then you are short that call (in both senses) because when the value of the call rises, you lose money because that is your liability.

Things get a little confusing when we mix the two meanings of long/short in the context of options.  Enjoy the following exercises - such sentences are ubiquitous in options markets - and remember splash the cold water liberally:

**Exercises:**

1.  If you have a net long position in a put, are you long or short the underlying?

1.  If you have a net short position in a put, are you long or short the underlying?

1.  If you have a net long position in a call, are you long or short the underlying?

1.  If you have a net short position in a call, are you long or short the underlying?
