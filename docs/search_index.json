["index.html", "Learning Options from Data Welcome", " Learning Options from Data Pritam Dalal Welcome Welcome to the website for Learning Options from Data. This innovative manual will teach you the theoretical and practical fundamentals of options. While a bit of math is unavoidable, and infact rather useful, the main tool for learning will be wrangling and analyzing real-world options data. These pages distill 1000s of hours of formal study through the filter of a decade of trading and analysis work in various areas of quantitative finance. I have included only what is uselful, timely, and relvant. This website is free to use and always will be. The book is written in RMarkdown with bookdown. Many thanks to the developers at RStudio for creating these wonderful packages for authoring - this book would not have been possible without those tools. "],
["introduction.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Delta-Neutral 1.2 Why This Book 1.3 Who Is This Book For? 1.4 How to Read 1.5 Acknowledgments 1.6 About the Author", " 1 Introduction The purpose of this initial chapter is to provide some context and motivation for how and why this book was written. For those of you who want to get tot the good stuff, it can safely be skipped. If you’re like me, you probably heard some crusty old professor overstate the importance of introductions of books and mistook his pedantry for wisdom. I urge you to mimic the more productive readers and just skip this chapter until you have 20 minutes fritter away, or you are having trouble sleeping. 1.1 Delta-Neutral This book would not have been possible without the support of by data partner: Delta Neutral. When I was asked to teach a finacial data analysis course at the University of Minnesota, I knew I wanted a real-world data set to be the bedrock of the curriculum. A few years prior, I had purchased a years worth of Delta Neutral’s eod-of-day files to complete a backtest that I was working on. I was immeasurably impressed with the data, especially when compared to that of their competators, both in terms of price and quality. Delta Neutral was founded in 2002 by Rick Fortier; at the time he was looking for high quality daily option data, and there simply were no reasonable sources, and so he saw a market opportunity. Options data is complex. Rick and his team have hit a homerun with their product. When I approached Rick about showcasing his data in my courses, he was excited to help spread knowledge of options and data analysis through this innovative channel. Nearly all the data analysis examples in this book come from Delta Neutral’s Level 3 product. This is a phenominal data set of the highest quality that contains daily prices for all options traded on thousands of equity underlyings. The full data set goes back to 2002. Feel free to reach out me, or to the team at Delta Netural, if you have further questions about their data offerings: support@deltaneutral.com. 1.2 Why This Book This book emanated from a course I was asked to teach for Master of Financial Mathematics (MFM) Program at the University of Minnesota. My initial vision for the course was a short but intensive module on backtesting options trading strategies. It would be geared towards advanced students who had already had year long sequences in both options theory and computer programming. The idea was that this module would help the student put their knew skill to the test with a challenging data analysis problem - precisely the kind of project they would be required to execute on the job. Due to a scheduling conflict this initial vision had to be modified. Instead I would be teaching similar material, but at a more introductory level to the first year students. The typical first year MFM student math majors with minimial previous exposure to options or programming. So generally very smart students with a solid educational foundation, but with little in the way of directly applicabile knowlege to the task of backtesting options. As I pondered the task, it occured to me that I was going to have to present both the basic definition of an option as well as the basic definition of a for-loop. To guide students from that point, to the point of being able to backt trading strategies seemed like an impossibly tall order. But I was intrigued by the challenge and so I accepted. While designing the course, I knew that I wanted to introduce data analysis material as quickly as possible, but that I was also going to have to cover a lot of options basics up front as well. I quickly realized that basic coding material has been presented exceptionally well in texts such as R for Data Science, so I could simply assign readings from these texts as self-study assignments. The key motivating insight for me was that many important things about options can be best illustrated by manipulating data. As I reflected, I concluded that many of my greatest learnings about options came when my hands were very dirty in the data (and NOT by writing out equations with a pen and a paper). Moreover, by learning about options via programming, you also develop the single most important practical skill for a quantitative finance professional: expressing financial ideas in code. Thus, I set out to write this new approach finance: Learning Options from Data (LOD). 1.3 Who Is This Book For? I classify the target audience for this book in terms of the particular subject matter that they are primarily interested in learning: Options and Coding: The readers who will get the most out of this book will be those that are similar to my MFM students - students who want to learn data analysis in a quantitative finance context, but who still need to build foundations in both areas. My University of Minnesota courses are based on systematically working through this book, as well as the further reading assignments. Coding: Suppose you are a professional that has a solid knowledge of options, and you would like to build some additional data analysis skills in R or Python. (Shameless plug: these are precisely the kind of learners that are served by the bespoke training courses from Option Data Science.) You can use this book by jumping straight to the coding exercises, and perusing the explantory material as needed. You will spend a fair amount of time on the prerequisite reading assignments from the coding books mentioned in the next section. Options: Suppose you are a data scientist or developer that needs to apply their skills in a quantitative finance context. For you, the coding will be simple, but you will need to focus on the explanatory finance material to be able to truly understand the coding assignments. You will spend a fair amount of time on the prerequisite reading assignments from the finance books mentioned in the next section. Delta-Neutral: If you have already purchased, or are considering purchasing, the Delta-Neutral data set, this book can serve as a guided initial exploration of the data. The coding exerices in this book wil greatly accelarate your learning curve. As you probably know, a huge amount time gets spent figuring out a new data set and performing initial wrangling tasks. Any head start you can give yourself on the long and arduous journey of data-wrangling, the better. 1.4 How to Read This section details some of the guiding prinicples I enlisted in writing this book; these provide insights on how to use the book for maximum return on your investment of time. 1.4.1 Guiding Philosophies Coding without Context Sucks I have a huge amount of affection for Hadley Wickham’s R for Data Science and similar titles. So much so that this book was written in it’s image. So much so that this morning I spent 20 minutes figuring how to get my welcome page to look the exactly like his - yeah I know, I’ve got issues. A general data analysis book like R4DS, by by it’s very nature, cannot be context specific. But ultimately, I’m usually left feeling a little bit empty and drowsy performing analysis on toy data sets about cars or flights. The truth is that it’s always more enjoyable and effective learn data analysis when you care about the data. That’s really the thrust of this book - learning data analysis in the context of options. Type Along Pen and paper is dead. If you’re not typing code and watching output come out, you’re not really learning. The interactive coding environments of R and Python are ideal for this kind of learning. Even if you think you have no idea of what is going on, if there is a coding example, force yourself to type it out (copy/paste doesn’t count) and make sure you get the same result. I’m Don’t Reinvent the Wheel So much for avoiding cliches. The point is that there has been a ton of great introductory material written on both data analysis and options. While I do present my take on some of this material, I also assign reading from a few other texts (which are mentioned below). This book is still only weakly self-contained, and is best studied along side the companion texts. 1.4.2 Prerequisites The math prerequisite to mastering options is a strong intuitive understanding of calculus, linear algebra, probablility, and statistics. For most people, this can really only be acquired from a 3-semester calculus sequence, and semester long undergraduate courses in the other three areas. The options self-help community would probaby argue that you don’t need that much math, but I disagree. There are certainly diminishing practical returns to advanced subjects like stochastic calculus and functional analysis, but the areas I detail above are a far cry from that. In my experience, the most productive finance professionals are those who have a strong intuitive understanding of basic undergraduate mathematics, who roll their eyes at theoretical details, and who focus on implementing their knowledge in code as quickly as possible. This book is designed for learning data in the context of quantitative finance, but I don’t over the basics of either topic thoroughly. So if you are lacking basic knowledge in either areas, you’ll need to spend some time on the suggested reading. 1.4.3 Further Reading This book is a hybrid of an introductory data analysis text and an introductory options text. It’s a jack of two trades, and master of neither. LOD is designed to be a companion to the books detailed below. Throughout this text, I will assign readings from these other books for one of two reasons: 1) addressing basics that have already been exposited well elsewhere; 2) a deeper dive into material for those who want to know more. The amount of further reading you will need will depend on your background and your interests.

Thank you to the authors Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemund, and Hadley Wickham for making the files freely available on Github. Many thanks to the students at the University of Minnesota, who’s questions and curiosities helped to guide the writing of this book. 1.6 About the Author This book was written by Pritam Dalal, founder of Option Data Science - a boutique consultancy focused on the intersection between data science and volatility markets. Prior to launching ODS, Pritam held a variety of trading and analysis roles at firms such as Cargill, Wolverine Trading, Allianz Investment Management, and Two Harbors Investment Corp. A common thread running through all of his work has been data-driven analysis, coupled with the ability to communicate those findings to fellow decision makers. These skills have been applied to areas ranging from volatility trading in commodity markets, to equity option market-making, and hedging complex annuities. In addition to serving clients, Pritam is an adjunct professor in the mathematics department where he teaches graduate students about applying data science to quantitative finance. Pritam holds a Bachelors in Mathematics and Economics from U.C. Berkeley, and a Masters in Financial Mathematics from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

["options-101.html", "2 Options 101 2.1 Car Insurance 2.2 Vanilla Options 2.3 Long vs Short", " 2 Options 101 The purpose of the chapter is to introduce the rudiments of options. I will start intuitive, and introduce formalism as necessary. Options are simple contracts that show up everywhere in finance. They can be viewed as the building blocks of many other financial instruments. The theory of option pricing serves as the foundation of much of quantitative finance. Options are insurance contracts wrapped around other financial assets. The asset that is being insured is called the underlying. The underlyings we are going to consider in this book will be stocks and ETFs, but the essential concepts are the same for other underlyings such as interest rates, corn futures, or barrels of oil. Let’s build some intuition by considering a type of insurance that you are probably familiar with: car insurance. 2.1 Car Insurance Wolverine Trading is a successful market-making firm based in Chicago. Following the lead of billionaire Warren Buffet, who’s major cash-cow is GEICO, the partners at Wolverine are interested in getting into the car insurance business. They have hired us as consultants to help devise a pricing policy for this exciting new business venture. The type of underlying that Wolverine would like to insure is: a specific driver coupled with a specific vehicle. The driver that is being insured is going to pay Wolverine premium. In exchange for the premium, Wolve will reimburse the driver whenever damage to the car exceeds a certain dollar amount, called the strike of the contract. Intuition Check: Do you think that Wolverine should charge the same premium irrespective of the underlying? Why or why not? After some deliberation, we have decided that price differentiation should based on the following contract features and underlying characteristics: strike, time to expiration, price of the underlying, volatility of the underlying. Let’s explore these one by one. Price of Underlying Sandra is a prospective customer; she has two vehicles that she wants to switch over. One is a busted old Mazda 3 that she bought when she was a struggling graduate student. The other is a fancy self-driving Tesla she bought after starting her lucrative options trading career. -ADD SIDE BY SIDE PICTURES HERE- Intuition Check: Which car should be more expensive to insure? Why? Strike Price of Contract Wolverine has three different strike prices that they can offer Sandra for her Tesla: $0 (“at-the-money”) $1,000 $5,000 Exercise: Order the premium for the three strike prices from cheapest to most expensive. Explain your answers. Time to Expiration Wolve Auto has three different contract tenors they can offer to Sandra for her Tesla: 0.25 years 0.50 years 1.00 years Exercise: Order the premium for the three tenors from cheapest to most expensive. Explain your answer. Voltility of Underlying Wolve is pricing insurance for two different customers, Sally and Patty. Both are looking to purchase insurance a fancy new self-driving Tesla. They both want a 1-year contract with with a $1,000 strike price. Sally’s friends describe her as calm, chill, responsible, quiet, serene. On the other hand, Patty’s friends describe her: wild, hyper, flakey, loud, and volatile. Intuition Check: Who should Wolverine charge more for insurance? Why? Insurance Payoff Graph It’s 8 a.m. on a Saturday morning. Sally is driving on the freeway heading to her Crossfit class: hands at 10-and-2, eyes intently on the road, soothing classical music playing in the background. Patty is also driving on the freeway, making her way home from an all night rave. As she drives, she smokes cigarette, touches up her makeup, and then snaps a few selfies for her IG stories (morning car selfies have the best light…OMG). Suddenly, Patty loses control and swerves in front of Sally. Patty is riding dirty and has no insurance, but responsible Sally a made sure to switch over to a $1000-strike Wolverine policy. Here is a graph of the payoff to Sally’s insurance contract immediately following the accident. (Make sure to type out this code along with me!!) strike &lt;- 1000 damage &lt;- seq(0, 3000, 500) payoff &lt;- pmax(damage - strike, 0) heading &lt;- &quot;insurance payoff&quot; plot(damage, payoff, type = &quot;n&quot;, main = &quot;Payoff to Sally&quot;) lines(damage, payoff, type = &quot;l&quot;) Notice that if the damage is less than the $1,000 strike price, Sally recieves no reimbursement from her insurance. For every dollar over the strike price, Sally recieves a one-for-one payout. Publicly traded option contracts, which are the subject of this book, behave similarly. 2.2 Vanilla Options Options come in many different varieties: European, American, Asian, digital, look-back, etc. European and American options are considered the simplest and for that reason they are collectively referred to as vanilla options. All other options are considered more complicated and are therefore referred to as exotic. Vanilla options are transacted in far greater volumes than exotics, and nearly all publicly traded options are vanilla. In this book I focus exclusively on vanillas. American Options as Insurance American (equity) options are insurance contracts that have as their underlying publicly traded stocks. They are called options because owning them gives you a right to do something, but you are not required to exercise that right. You have the option exercise if it happens to be beneficial to you. This right with out obiligation has the effect of creating an insurance benefit for the option holder. American options come in two varieties: puts and calls. Put contracts are insurance for those who already own the stock and intend to sell it in the future; they are protection against the price of the stock falling before they’ve had a chance to sell it. Call contracts are insurance for those who intend to buy stock in the future; they are protection against the price of the stock rising before they’ve had a chance to buy it. In reality, you don’t have to purchase either puts or calls as insurance. You don’t have to own the underlying to buy a put. If you do happen to own the underlying, you don’t have to intend to sell it. Nor do you have to intend to buy the underlying in the future in order to buy calls. You can buy or sell either types of contracts to express different views on the underlying. American Option Contract Specification After a lot of hand waving, I’m finally ready to give a proper contract specification for American options. You are no doubt tingling with anticipation. Prepare to be let down - things won’t get interesting until you complete a couple of years of banal study. Let’s consider American options on some stock \\(S\\). Puts and calls on \\(S\\) are defined by two additional contract features: strike price and expiration date. Call: a contract that gives the right, but not the obligation, to buy a share of \\(S\\) at the strike price any time before the expiration date. Put: a contract that gives the right, but not the obligation, to sell a share of \\(S\\) at the strike price any time before the expiration date. See, I told you…pretty lame. Option Buyers and Option Sellers There are two sides to every options transaction. The option buyer pays premium and owns a right. The option seller, on the other hand, receives premium and is obligated to respect the right that the buyer has purchased. In the case of puts, if the option buyer exercise their right to sell the underlying, the option seller is obligated to buy the underlying from them. In the case of calls, if the option buyer exercise their right to buy the underlying, the option seller is obligate to sell the underlying to them. Sentences like those in the previous paragraph can be a little confusing at first. There are a lot of “buys” and “sells”&quot; floating around. Don’t worry, it will get less confusing over time, and at some level you will never get over need to splash some cold water on your face, take a walk around the block, then go back to the definition of puts and calls. Exercises: Ruobing has purchased an American call on SPY with a strike price of $250. He paid $10 in premium. Farez was the option seller on this transaction. It’s now the final day of the contract and Ruobing has still not exercised his right. Under what circumstances will Ruobing choose to excericse his right? Under what circumstances does Ruobing make money? Under what circumstances does Farez make money? What are the min and max of Ruobing’s PNL (include premium)? What are the min and max of Farez’s PNL (include premium)? Answer the same questions for a put with the same strike, expiration, and premium. European vs American European options are very similar to Americans. The only difference is that the owner of a European option can only exercise their right immediately after the final trading day of the contract. Recall that with American the option holder can early exercise at any point before expiration. To summarize: European options have an exercise date (point). American options have an exercise window - it starts today and ends on expiration. It turns out that in most cases it is not optimal to early exercise an American option (we will explore these arguments in the following chapter). For this reason, we will consider American and European the options as being the same (only the most pedantic of quants will take issue with this). Because there is only one point of time at which a European option can be exercised, the notion of a payoff function is completely straight-forward: it is the value of exercising at the time of expiration. With American options, the notion of a payoff function is complicated by the possibility of early exerise. However, we will lean on the fact that it is almost never optimal to early exercise an American options, and also define their payoff function as the value of exercising at the time of expiration. Payoff Function At this point I will introduce some mathematical notation, as it become more efficient to communicate about options with a bit of notation (but not too much). Suppose the current date is \\(t\\) . Consider a put and call have the same underlying, the same expiration \\(T &gt; t\\), and the same strike price \\(K\\). Let \\(S_{T}\\) be the price of the stock at expiration. Let \\(\\pi_{b}\\) be the put buyer’s payoff, and let \\(\\pi_{c}\\) be the call buyer’s payoff. Then we have that: Put Buyer Payoff: \\(\\pi_{p}(S_{T}) = \\max \\big \\{(K - S_{T}),0 \\big \\}\\) Call Buyer Payoff: \\(\\pi_{c}(S_{T}) = \\max \\big \\{(S_{T} - K), 0 \\big \\}\\) Exercises: Convince yourself that the above is true given the contract specification of vanilla puts and call. Graph \\(\\pi_{p}\\) and \\(\\pi_{c}\\) as a function of \\(S_{T}\\). Write the expressions for seller’s payoff of both puts and calls. Draw the graphs. Total PNL takes into account the option premium. Let \\(m_{p}\\) be the put premium and let \\(m_{c}\\) be the call premium. Modify all four of your graphs to be total pnl functions, rather than payoff functions. If we consider \\(\\pi_{p}\\) and \\(\\pi_{c}\\) as functions of \\(S_T \\in (0, +\\infty)\\), then both functions are differentiable at all points except for \\(S_T = K\\). What are the two values of \\(\\frac{d\\pi_{c}}{dS_{T}}\\)? What are the two values of \\(\\frac{d\\pi_{p}}{dS_{T}}\\)? Recall that the current time is \\(t\\) and let \\(S_{t}\\) be the current price of the stock. If you own the put, which inequality do you hope is true between \\(S_{t}\\) and \\(S_{T}\\). What ineqality do you hope holds true between between \\(S_{T}\\) and \\(K\\)? If you own the call, which inequality do you hope is true between \\(S_{t}\\) and \\(S_{T}\\)? How about between \\(S_{T}\\) and \\(K\\)? 2.3 Long vs Short If you spend time around financial markets you are likely to encounter the jargon terms and “short” and “long”. Only rarely will the speakers be discussing mullets. These terms can be a bit confusing to the uninitiated, but used in moderation they are a useful shorthand. In this section I unpack this jargon, as we will make use of it in the rest of the text. Buyers vs Sellers Let’s return to the car insurance industry for a moment. In any transaction there is a buyer and a seller. In the car insurance market there are certain classes of entities that buy the insurance, and other classes of entities that sell the insurance. For example, I have purchased car insurance from State Farm and GEICO (you’re welcome Warren). However, there would never be a situation in which GEICO or State Farm would buy a car insurance policy from me. Options markets are different in this respect. Various classes of entities - market-makers, hedge-funds, retail traders - buy options as well as sell options. For example, on given trading day, I may sell an option which a hedge-fund may buy from me on an exchange. On the following day, I may buy a different option from that same hedge fund. Said in a different way, in options market, any particular entity can simultaneously be a buyer of options and a seller of options. Net Position As you saw in earlier exercises, the payoff of the option sell is the negative of the payoff of the option buyer. So let’s associate the number \\(+1\\) with the act of buying an option, and let’s associate the number \\(-1\\) with the act of selling an option contract. More generally, we can associate a quantity number \\(Q\\) with an options trade. If \\(Q&gt;0\\) then the trade is to buy \\(Q\\) options. If \\(Q &lt; 0\\) then the trade is to sell \\(|Q|\\) options. Intuition Check: What is the payoff function for buying \\(Q\\) options and holding them until they expire? Suppose a trader named Lewei has engaged in \\(n\\) trades on a particular contract \\(\\mathcal{O}\\). And suppose that the quantities of the trades were \\(Q_{1}, \\ldots, Q_{n}\\). Liwei’s net position in the option \\(\\mathcal{O}\\) is \\(Q^{*}\\) where \\[\\begin{align*} Q^{*} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Q_{i}. \\end{align*}\\] This concept of net position brings us to our first meanings of long and short: Long: If \\(Q^{*}&gt;0\\) we say that Lewei is long \\(Q^{*}\\) contracts of \\(\\mathcal{O}\\). More generally, we would say that Lewei has a net long position in \\(\\mathcal{O}\\). Short: If \\(Q^{*}&lt;0\\) we say that Lewei is short \\(|Q^{*}|\\) contracts of \\(\\mathcal{O}\\). More generally, we would say that Lewei has a net short position in \\(\\mathcal{O}\\). So, we say that you are long a contract if you are a net buyer of the contract, and we say you are short the contract if you are a net seller of the contract. Value The other meanings of long/short has to do with how you depending on the direction of change of the price of an asset. You are said to be long an asset if you make money when the value of that asset goes up. You are said to be short an asset if you make money when the value of that asset goes down. So for example, if you hold AAPL in your 401(K), then you are long AAPL because the value of your retirement savings increases when Apple’s stock price rises. Similarly, if you have a net short position in a call, then you are short that call (in both senses) because when the value of the call rises, you lose money because that is your liability. Things get a little confusing when we mix the two meanings of long/short in the context of options. Enjoy the following exercises - such sentences are ubiquitous in options markets - and remember splash the cold water liberally: Exercises: If you have a net long position in a put, are you long or short the underlying? If you have a net short position in a put, are you long or short the underlying? If you have a net long position in a call, are you long or short the underlying? If you have a net short position in a call, are you long or short the underlying? "],

It is the most academic chapter, and I hesitated to unleash these gory details, as my initial vision of the book was to be totally practical. I ultimately decided to get a little mathy on you for a couple of reasons. The first reason is that I’m a recovering quantitative finance nerd, and writing this book is something of a relapse for me. The second reason is that I frequently get questions from my MFM students that requires resorting to this level of formalism. Out of of a genuine interest for their well beings, I try to let the know that getting caught up such details is a frivolous waste of time. And even though it pains me to contribute to their budding pathology by ingulging in such pedantry, I figure they have paid tuition so I probably owe them an answer. Of course this line of thought is probably just the rationalization of a math addict. I envy those of you who can take the statements of fact in this chapter as given, and then move on to more elevated pursuits. 3.1 Arbitrage An arbitrage is a risk-less profit that requires no initial investment. One of the basic tenets of quantitative finance is that arbitrage opportunities should not exist in the markets. The reasoning is as follows: if an arbitrage exists, market participants will pile onto the trade and thus move prices until the arb no longer exists. Mathematically minded nerds with lots of time on their hands use arbitrage arguments to prove theorems about the nature of markets. In doing so, they make stylized, and often questionable, assumptions about markets, glossing over certain details to make their mathematical stories work seemlessly. Abitrage arguments are highly academic in nature, and plenty of that work is of limited importance to finance practitioners (or anyone for that matter). There is, however, a strong kernel of truth to these arguement. If markets signficantly breach so-called no arbitrage prices, then there will be very safe and profitable trades in the market. Traders will eventually catch on to the these trades, which will cause prices to move toward the no-arbitrage levels. Keep your eyes peeled for arbs in the market. And if you find one, please call me. 3.2 Stocks &amp; Dividends Companies can raise funds to grow their business by issuing shares of stock. The buyer of the stock, called a shareholder, pays money to the comapany which the company keeps forever. In return, the shareholder is entitled to a fraction of the companies future profits and also has the ability to vote on certain matters at shareholder meetings. A crucial point is that the owner of a stock has limited liability with resepct to the company. The worst thing that can happen is that shareholder never recieves any profits, and the stock itself also becomes worthless. So, for example, if the company is caught illegally polluting, the shareholder cannot be sued for damages. In this sense the value of stock can never be negative. Once a stock has been issued by a company, the owner of the stock can sell it to another investor. This is called a secondary market transaction. Once the share has been sold in the secondary market, the claims to profits and the voting rights are both transferred to the purchaser. Secondary market transactions occur on exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange, and are usually what people mean when they talk about the stock market. These transactions occur via complicated auction mechanisms that match buyers and sellers. The mechanisms are such that the actual trade prices can fluctuate (sometimes greatly) from transaction to transaction. Here are some example of companies who’s stocks trade heavily in the secondary markets. AAPL - Apple (you seriously have an Android bro) GOOG - Alphabet (…dude iPhones are totally overrated) FB - Facebook (please like my pics and make me feel cool) XOM - Exxon Mobile (I’m self-righteous about the environment…until I check my 401K) Suppose you want to trade a share of stock, and you want to be able to fill your order immediately. If you are a buyer of the stock, you will be charged a certain amount called the ask price. If you are a seller of the stock you will recieve a certain amount called the bid price. The bid price is lower than the ask price. These so-called bid-ask spreads exist in other financial markets as well, including options markets. If you are a market participant for a particular stock, there are three prices that you will surely need to keep your eye one. The current bid price, the current ask price, and the last price at which a trade occurred. I will often refer to the price of a stock at time \\(t\\) and denote by \\(S_{t}\\). Typically, you can safely gloss over what the phrase the price of the stock exactly means. If you need to get into the minutae, you will find that I probably mean one of the following: 1) the current mid price, which is as the average of the bid and ask at time \\(t\\); 2) the last trade price as of time \\(t\\). For stocks that have high trading volume, these two values will be usually quite close - but this is not always the case. The upshot of our previous discussion about exchanges is that \\(S_{t}\\) varies through time. As it turns out, it is useful to think of the of \\(S_{t}\\) as a series of random variable. In fancy math circles this is know as a stochastic process. It is my intention to avoid mathematical nerdery as much as possible, but sometimes I will be forced to indulge is such evils. My apologies in advanced. When profits are distributed to the owners of a stock, this is done on a per share basis. The amount that is paid per share is called a dividend payment. It is reasonable to wonder whether issuing a dividend payment has any near-term impact on the price of the stock. As it turns out it does, and this question leads to our first qunatitative result involving an arbitrage argument. Theorem: Suppose that a stock is going make a divided payment of \\(c\\) at time \\(T\\) and that just prior to the dividend payment is trading at a price of \\(S^{*}\\). Then then price of the stock just after the dividend payment is \\(S_{T} = S^{*} - c\\). Proof: NEED TO FILL IN. Properly defining the concept of a share of stock is a complicated legal exercise. Similarly, an accurate description of how stocks are bought and sold in the secondary market would require its own large (and boring) book. The amount of detail you will ultimately know depends on how you intend to apply your knowledge. For example, if you are an attorney that works on IPOs, you will need to know a lot about the legal stuff. If you are a creating statistical arbitrage strategies, you will need be an expert on exchange microstructure. For the purposes of this book, the following stylized facts will suffice. A shareholder owns stock which give them claim to a company’s future profits. This is a limited liability investment in that the value of a stock can never be negative. After their initial issuance, shares of stock can be bought and sold in the secondary market. Trading of stocks on the secondary market occurs on exchanges, with trades occurring thousands or millions of times a day during business hours. The exchange creates complex auction mechanisms to match buyers and sellers. The rules of these auctions are such that trades can occur at different prices for every transaction. Trade prices can and do vary greatly from transaction to transaction. The stream of trade prices is often denoted as \\(S_{t}\\) can be conceptualized as a stochastic process. Profits are paid out to shareholders in the form of a per-share payment called a dividend. Immediately after the payment of a dividend, the stock price will reduce by the amount of the dividend. 3.3 Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Investing in stocks and other assets is usually an overly costly and complex proposition for an individual. For this reason, there are various vehicles for small investors to pool their money, and for it to then be invested under the auspices of invmentment professionals. The most common for of investment pooling is a mutual fund. More esoteric manifestations are hedge funds, unit invesment trust (UIT), and real estate investment trusts (REIT). The distinction between these is of general interest, but won’t be of huge importance to us in this book. A fairly recent innovation in the world of pooled invesments is exchange traded funds (ETFs). Relative to mutual funds and hedge funds, ETFs engage in simpler strategies that are easier to execute. For this reason, it take fewer people to manage the fund and costs are low. In additon, sharte of ETFs are traded on exchanges in the exact same way as share of stock. ETFs also pay dividends in the same way that stocks do. Here are some popular ETFs: SPY - SPDR SP500 - tracks the S&amp;P500. IWM - iShares Russell 2000. GLD - invests in gold future. XLF - SPDR Financial - tracks the performance of financial services sector. For the purpose of this course, we will treat stocks and ETFs as largely the same. 3.4 Discounting &amp; Accumulating When you lend money, you are paid interest to compensate for the fact that you can’t use the money to lent for other purposes. In this book I assume loans are totally safe and there is no risk of default. It is useful to the of the loan amount accumulating with interest. I use the following notation and nomenclature to capture this idea of accumulation: Definition: Assume the current time is \\(t\\) and that \\(T\\) is some time in the future. Then one dollar will accumulate to \\(A(t,T)\\) by time \\(T\\). I will call \\(A(t,T)\\) an accumulation factor. If you are going to recieve money in the future, it’s not really worth as much to you as if the money were paid right now. The way we account for this value difference is by essentially discounting by the amount of interest you could have earned between now when you are going to be paid. The is the notion of present value and I express it as follows: Definition: The time \\(t\\) present value of a one dollar cashflow at time \\(T\\) will be denoted by \\(D(t,T)\\). I will call \\(D(t,T)\\) a discount factor. I will call \\(D(t, T)\\) a discount factor. The following statements are true: \\(A(t,T) \\geq 1\\). \\(D(t, T) \\leq 1\\). \\(D(t,T) = A(t,T)^{-1}\\). Definition: Suppose the current time is \\(t\\) and consider a series of cashflows \\(C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{n}\\) occurring at future times \\(t_{1}, \\ldots t_{n}\\). Then the time \\(t\\) present value of this stream of cashflows is defined as: \\[\\begin{align*} PV(\\{ C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{n} \\}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} D(t, t_{i}) \\cdot C_{i}. \\end{align*}\\] 3.4.0.1 Forward Accumulating Suppose that the current time is \\(t\\) and that \\(T\\) is some time in the (distant) future. Suppose you know at for all \\(s \\in (t, T)\\) that all the values of \\(A(t,t)\\). This is set of accumulation factors is known as the spot yield curve (it is usually quoted in rates, but the idea is the same). Now, suppose for some particular \\(t^* \\in (t, T)\\) you want to work out an arrangement with your bank such that you will deposit one dollar at time \\(t^*\\) and let it accumulate until \\(T\\). What is the accumlation factor that you should earn? It turns out that this forward accumulation factor is determined by the spot yield curve. We will denote the quantity \\(A(t, t^*, T)\\). There is a simple no-arbitrage argument for this but I won’t bother presenting it here becuase it’s not import. All you need to know is that it satisfies the following equation \\[\\begin{align*} A(t, T) = A(t, t^*) \\cdot A(t, t^*, T) \\end{align*}\\] 3.5 Option Contracts We discussed vanilla (American and European) options at length in the previous section, but I wll 3.6 Forward Contracts Forward contracts are simple derivatives that are one of the foundational building blocks in the theory and practice of quantitative finance. The value of forwards are related to option prices via a result known as put-call parity, a finding seminal to much of derivatives theory. 3.6.1 Specification and Payoff A forward contract this the obligation to transact some underlying asset at some future date, at a fixed price, called the strike price. The party that agrees to buy the underlying, is called the long side; the party that agrees to sell the underlying is the short side. The underlyings we will consider in this book will be stocks or ETFs, but forwards can exist on any kind of underlying: gold, corn, etc. The key feature of a forward is that both sides are obligated to execute their side of the transaction - to either buy our sell the asset, at the agreed upon strike price. This stands in contrast to an option, in which the long side has a right, while the short side has an obligation. Suppose a forward contract struck at \\(K\\) expires at time \\(T\\). Suppose that underlying is trading at \\(S_{T}\\) at the time of expiration. The long side has to pay \\(K\\) and in return receives the underlying which has a value of \\(S_{T}\\). Thus the long position is worth \\(S_{T} - K\\) at expiration. On the other hand, the short side recieves \\(K\\) but has to deliver the underlying, which is worth \\(S_{T}\\). So the short position is worth \\(K - S_{T}\\). Long Payoff: \\(S_{T} - K\\) Short Payoff: \\(S_{T} - K\\) 3.6.2 The Forward Price Suppose that the current time is \\(t\\) and that we are considering a forward contract that expires at time \\(T\\). Suppose further that the underlying is currently trading at \\(S_{t}\\). We are interested in the following questions: is there strike price of \\(K\\) such that both parties can enter into the forward contract for zero cost, without introducing an arbitrage opportunity for either side? It turns out the answer is yes, an this strike price is of such importance that it has been named simply, the forward price. A forward price is determined by two points in time: the current time \\(t\\) and the expiration time \\(T\\). We will denote the forward price associated with these two times as \\(F(t, T)\\). Forward Pricing Formula: Suppose we are considering a forward contract at time \\(t\\) which expires at time \\(T\\). Suppose that the underlying is currently trading at \\(S_{t}\\) and that during the life of the forward, the underlying stock pays dividends \\(c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\) at times \\(t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{n}\\). Then the we have that: \\[\\begin{align*} F(t, T) &amp;= A(t, T) \\cdot S_{t} - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} A(t, t_{i}, T) \\cdot c_{i} \\end{align*}\\] In words we have that the forward price is the accumulated value of the current stock price less the accumulated value of all the dividend payments during the life of the contract. Notice that for non-dividend paying stocks we have that: \\(F(t, T) = A(t, T) \\cdot S_{t}\\). 3.6.3 Valuing a Forward Contract Suppose that you enter into a forward contract at time \\(t^{*}\\) and the strike price \\(K\\) was chosen such that both parties could enter into the contract for zero cost. Suppose that the time is now \\(t &gt; t^{*}\\), what would be the value to unwind this contract? Fact: The no arbitrage unwind value of this contract is \\(D(t, T) \\cdot (F(t, T) - K)\\). This result really has nothing to do with the fact that the forward contract entered into at time \\(t^{*}\\) or that it’s initial strike what chosen to make it a zero value contract. Ultimately it just gives us a formula for valuing a forward contract at any point. Notice that if a forward contract is struck at the current forward price, then it has zero value, which we would expect. 3.6.4 Synthetic Forwards A portfolio consisting of a long call and a short put is a synthetic forward position. Let the current time be \\(t\\). Consider a call and put on the same underlying, with the same strike price \\(K\\), that both expire at time \\(T\\). If you have a long position in the call and a short position in the put, then in all states of the world at time \\(T\\) this portfolio has a value of \\(S_{T} - K\\), which is the same value as the payoff as a long forward. Suppose that \\(S_{T} &gt; K\\). You exercise your long call, for which you recieve the stock worth \\(S_{T}\\) whilie paying the strike price \\(K\\) for it. The put you are short expires worthless. The total value of these two positions is \\(S_{T} - K\\). On the other hand, suppose \\(S_{T} &lt; K\\). Your short put postion will be exercised, forcing you to buy the stock for \\(K\\) even though it is only worth \\(S_{T}\\). Your call is worthless, so you won’t exercise. Once again, the combined value of these two position is \\(S_{T} - K\\). If \\(S_{T} = K\\), nothing happens because both options are worthless. Doing nothing has zero value. But of course in this situation we have that \\(S_{T} - K = 0\\). 3.7 Put-Call Parity Let the current time be \\(t\\) and consider a put and a call that both expire at time \\(T\\) and that are both struck at \\(K\\). From the previous section we know that a long call and a short put create a synthetic forward struck at \\(K\\). We also know how to value any forward contract. Putting these two results together we get following put-call parity identity. \\[\\begin{align*} C(t, T, K) - P(t, T, K) = D(t, T) \\cdot (F(t, T) - K) \\end{align*}\\] Put-call parity is one of the most important and foundational results in all of derivatives theory. Let’s examine a couple special cases more closely. Non-Dividend Paying Stock Recall that when the stock pays no dividends during the life of the forward, that the forward price is simply the accumulated spot price. Thus we can \\[\\begin{align*} C(t, T, K) - P(t, T, K) &amp;= D(t, T) \\cdot (F(t, T) - K) \\\\ &amp;= D(t, T) \\cdot (A(t, T) \\cdot S_{t} - K) \\\\ &amp;= S_{t} - D(t, T) \\cdot K \\end{align*}\\] Dividend Paying Stock Suppose that during the life of the options, that the underlying stockpays dividends \\(c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\) at times \\(t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{n}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} C(t, T, K) - P(t, T, K) &amp;= D(t, T) \\cdot (F(t, T) - K) \\\\ &amp;= D(t, T) \\cdot \\bigg(A(t, T) \\cdot S_{t} - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} A(t, t_{i}, T) \\cdot c_{i} - K \\bigg) \\\\ &amp;= S_{t} - PV(\\{c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{n} \\}) - D(t, T) \\cdot K \\end{align*}\\] 3.8 Rational Option Pricing The Black-Schole pricing framework, which will discuss at lenght in later chapters, requires complex assumptions about the random nature of the underlying, and dynamic trading strategies for replicating option payoffs. These complexities are required a specific value to an option, but there is a actually a lot we can say about option prices in general without making any assumptions of the underlying. Extreme American Bounds The worst thing that can happen with a put or call is that it is not exercised, which means that they can never be worth less than zero. For a call, the best thing that can happen is that you exercise, which results in owning the stock, a call can never be worth more than the underlying stock. For a put, the best outcome is that you exercise when the stock is worthless, and you recieve \\(K\\). Thus, the put can never be worth more that \\(K\\). These facts are summarized in the following inequalities \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp;\\leq C_A(S, K, T) \\leq S \\\\ 0 &amp;\\leq P_A(S, K, T) \\leq K. \\end{align*}\\] Americans \\(\\geq\\) European Any strategy that you can execute with a European option, you can execute with the American variant as well. Thus we have that \\[\\begin{align*} C_E(S, K, T) &amp;\\geq C_A(S, K, T) \\\\ P_E(S, K, T) &amp;\\geq C_A(S, K, T). \\end{align*}\\] Call Bounds We can string together put-call parity along with the previous two results (add equation numbers), to arrive at the following series of inequalities: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{max}\\big\\{ 0, D(t, T) \\cdot ((F(t, T) - K)) \\big\\} \\leq C_E(S, K, T) \\leq C_A(S, K, T) \\leq S. \\end{align*}\\] From left to right the justification for the three inequalities are as follows: Extreme lower bound combined with put-call parity. Notice that this is equivalent to saying that a vanilla call is always worth greater that intrinsic. Americans are worth more than Europeans. Extreme upper bound for Amerians. Put Bounds We can argue for a similar sequence of inequalities for puts: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{max}\\big\\{ 0, D(t, T) \\cdot (K - F(t, T)) \\big\\} \\leq P_E(S, K, T) \\leq P_A(S, K, T) \\leq K. \\end{align*}\\] From left to right the justification for the three inequalities are as follows: Extreme lower bound combined with put-call parity. Notice that this is equivalent to saying that a vanilla put is always worth greater that intrinsic. Americans are worth more than Europeans. Extreme upper bound for Amerians. Early Exercise No Dividends It is never optimal to early exercise an American call option on a non-dividend paying stock. For a non-dividend paying underlying, it is always better to sell the call than to exercise. To see this, recall that from put call parity we have that \\[\\begin{align*} C_E(S_t, K T) &amp;= D(t, T) \\cdot (F(t, T) - K) + P_E(K, T) \\\\ &amp;= D(t, T) \\cdot (A(t, T) \\cdot S_t - K)) + P_E(S_t, K, T) \\\\ &amp;= S_t - D(t, T) \\cdot K + P_E(S_t, K, T). \\end{align*}\\] If we can show that \\(S_t - D(t, T) \\cdot K + P_E(K, T) &gt; S_t - K\\) then we are done, because American options are always worth at least as much as Europeans. This inequality is equivalent to \\[\\begin{align*} K &gt; D(t, T) \\cdot K - P_E(S_t, K, T) \\iff \\\\ K\\cdot(1 - D(t, T)) + P_E(S_t, K, T) &gt; 0 \\end{align*}\\] But of course this final inequality is true because \\(D(t, T) &lt; 1\\) and \\(P_E(S_t, K, T) &gt; 0\\). Early Exercise Single Dividend (NOT COMPLETE) Consider and American call on a stock that pays a single dividend, call it \\(\\delta\\), before the option expires, say at time \\(t^*\\). From put-call parity we have \\[\\begin{align*} C_E(S_t, K, T) &amp;= D(t, T) \\cdot (F(t, T) - K) + P_E(S_t, K, T) \\\\ &amp;= D(t, T) \\cdot (A(t, T) \\cdot S_t - D(t, t^*)\\delta - K) + P(S_t, K, t) \\\\ &amp;= S_t - D(t, T) \\cdot D(t, t^*) \\delta - K \\cdot D(t, T) + P(S_t, K, t) \\end{align*}\\] "],

Suppose you hold the option until expiration, which is trade-date \\(t_{n}\\). The letter \\(i\\) will serve as an index over the trade-dates, so \\(i = 1,\\ldots,n\\).

We seek to define the following: Daily: \\(D_{i}\\) - the daily PNL for the trade as of end-of-day \\(t_i\\). TTD: \\(C_{i}\\) - the trade-to-date PNL for the trade as of end-of-day \\(t_i\\). Intuitively, the trade-to-date (TTD) PNL is the amount of money you made or lost if you unwind the trade at current market values. The daily PNL is the one day change in the trade-to-date PNL. The two concepts are interchangable in that it is possible to define TTD PNL in terms of daily PNL and vice-versa. In my own work, I find it most useful to calculate daily PNLs of each trade, and then define the cummulative PNL as the sum of the dailies. I present all both alternative below, for both buys and sells. TTD as Sum of Daily - Buy \\[\\begin{align*} D_{i} &amp;= \\begin{cases} B_{1} - P &amp; i = 1 \\\\ B_{i} - B_{i-1} &amp; i &gt; 1 \\end{cases} \\\\[10pt] C_{i} &amp;= \\sum_{k=1}^{i} D_{k} \\end{align*}\\] Exercise: Show that \\(C_{j} = B_{j} - P\\).

Rather, we will want to calculate the PNL of a portfolio of trades. This is a trivial matter, as the daily PNL of a collection of trades is simply the sum of the daily PNL of the individual trades. [CODING EXERCISE] 5.4 Returns While PNL is an important performance metric, it is often hard to interpret with first normalzing by the amount of capital required to fund the investment. This is precisely what the notion of a return is. We will let \\(R_{i}\\) be the day \\(t_{i}\\) be the return of a trading strategy "],
["option-pricing.html", "6 Option Pricing 6.1 Black-Scholes-Merton 6.2 Investment Risk Reduction 6.3 Forward Replication 6.4 Delta Hedging 6.5 Greeks", " 6 Option Pricing What the price of an option be at any given point in time? This seems like an innocent question, but it took the collective quantitative finance community over one hundred years to answer in a satisfactory way. Along the way modern finance was born. 6.1 Black-Scholes-Merton In the 1970s, decades of option pricing research coalesced into a pricing framework that yielded a fairly simple formula for pricing vanilla options. It is known as the Black-Scholes framework, being named after two of major contributers to it’s development Understanding the framework is more important than memorizing the formula. The upshot of the BSM pricing framework is that given several contract features, and several market values, you can assign a value to an option. Contract Features p/c - put or call \\(K\\) - strike price T - expiration date (time to expiration) Market Values \\(S_{t}\\) - current underlying price \\(\\sigma\\) - estimate of the standard deviation log-return of the price of underlying between now and expiration \\(\\delta\\) - estimate of dividends paid over the life of the option \\(r\\) - risk-free interest rate All the inputs of the BSM formula are readily observable, except for \\(\\sigma\\), also called volatility. The options market is the markets. The market for the underlying stock is the market. Question: Suppose Jake is an SPY trader for Wolverine and that on a given day, the price of SPY drops by 10%. Should Jake increase or decrease \\(\\sigma\\) in his pricing models? 6.2 Investment Risk Reduction The ultimate goal of this section is to discuss delta-hedging and option replication. However, the notion of hedging in an derivatives context is often confused with two other ideas in finance, so I want to spend some time teasing them apart. Towards this end we will discuss three related concepts: - diversification of investments - hedging of investments - hedging for derivatives replication (including delta-hedging) These three are related in that they are all manifestations of risk reduction. Diversification of Investments Let \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\) be two random variables with the same variance and \\(corr(X_1, X_2) &lt; 1\\). Then we have that \\[\\begin{align*} sd(0.5 \\cdot X_1 + 0.5 \\cdot X_2) &lt; sd(X_1) = sd(X_2). \\end{align*}\\] The financial intuition of this result is: if you are investing, and you have a choice between two assets that are equally risky (i.e. the same variance of returns), then you will always lower the riskiness of your portfolio by diversifying over both assets, rather than just investing in one. This result can be generalized to \\(n\\) random variables. Spread your money over many different non-perfectly correlated investments and you will reduce your overall portfolio risk. Exercises: Use the tidyqant package to download 5 years of SPY and IWM price data from Yahoo finance. Use the adjusted close prices to calculated daily log-returns for each ETF. Calculate the standard deviation of the daily returns for both, and then create a seriese of scaled prices for IWM so that the scaled prices has the same standard deviation as SPY. Hedging of Investments Hedging in an investment context can be thought of as an extreme form of diversification. Suppose you have a position in some asset \\(A\\). Suppose you believe that asset \\(B\\) has a strong anti-correlation with \\(A\\): when the price of \\(A\\) goes down, the price of \\(B\\) goes up, and vice-versa. If you were to invest in asset \\(B\\) for this reason, it would be referred to as a hedge against \\(A\\). In investments, diversification (previous concept) exploits uncorrelatedness, while hedging exploits anti-correlation. Exercises: Use the tidyquant package to download 5 years of SPY and GDX price data from Yahoo finance. Google the GDX ETF and find out what it’s all about. Suppose at the beginning of the 5 year period that you have $125K to invest. You know that for sure you are going to invest $100K in SPY, but you’re not sure what to do with the additional $25K. You consider two options: keep it in cash invest in GDX Compare the standard deviation of the portfolio returns for each choice. GDX is negatively correlated with SPY, so it would be a hedge in the investment sense. Confirm this by comparing the standard deviations of the two portfolios and also by visualizing with ggplot(). 6.3 Forward Replication Hedging in the context of derivatives means something quite different. It refers to engaging in a set of trades - called a replicating portfolio - that perfectly replicates the payoff of a derivative. If you can find such a replicating portfolio, and that replicating portfolio has a a known cost, then that is the no arbitrage price of the derivative. Hedging is a both a theoretical pricing technique, and also a prescription for action for a trading desk that deals derivative contracts to its customers. Yuchen works for Wolverine Trading’s forward contract desk. Yifei is one of Yuchen’s customers and would like to engage in a forward contract to buy a single share of SPY, 2 months from now. Suppoe th the current price of SPY is 265, and that the two-month interest rate is 1%. Suppose further that SPY does not pay any dividends between now and the expiration date of the forward contract. The price which Yifei agrees to buy SPY in 2 months is called the strike price. Let’s call it \\(K\\). If \\(K = 265 \\cdot (1 + 0.01) = 267.65\\), the forward contract has zero cost at the time of inception. The reason for this is that Yuchen can create a replicating portfolio for zero cost right now, that perfectly matches the payoff/obligations of the derivative. Yuchen’s replicating portfolio consists of the following: - he borrows 265 for two months (short a bond) - he buys a share of SPY (long the underlying) When the contract expires, Yuchen will collect 267.65 from Yefei and deliver the the stock. With the 267.65 that Yuchen collected, he will repay his loan, the balance of which is exactly 267.65. If Yuchen were to charge a slightly higher forward price on his contract, say 270, then engaging in the foward contract would yield 3.35 in riskless profit, two months from the inception of the contract, which at that time has a present value of \\(3.35 \\cdot (1 + 0.01)^{-1} = 3.32\\). Notice that Yuchen takes no risk, which is the ideal situation for a derivatives desk. This replicating portfolio does two thing for us: - gives us a way to argue zero cost forward price - gives Yuchen a prescription for action in his derivatives business Yuchen’s trades - selling a bond and buying underlying - are collectively an example of a static hedge. The portfolio is static in that doesn’t require any adjustments during the life of the contract - Yuchen can set it and forget it. More complicated derivatives, like vanilla options, require dynamic hedging.Their replicating portfolios which must be adjusted frequently. 6.4 Delta Hedging The BSM framework is a means for determining the price of an option, call it \\(P\\). It makes some stylized assumptions about the nature of the underlying and the market for the underlying: - thee underlying price process \\(S_{t}\\) follows a geometric brownian motion - markets trade continuously without a bid-ask spread The BSM posits that to hedge/replicate an options position, that we simply need to hold \\(-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial S_{t}}\\) units of the underlying at any point in time. Holding \\(-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial S_{t}}\\) units of the underlying is referred to as . Notice that \\(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial S_{t}}\\) is a constantly changing quantity, so you have to rebalance our delta-hedge frequently, which is what makes this a hedging strategy. The BSM assumptions are demostrably false, but they are close enough to being right that delta-hedging is a useful practice for derivatives dealers and options market-makers. As mentioned above, BSM assumes that \\(S_{t}\\) follows a geometric brownian motion. The is equivalent to saying that log-return of \\(S_{t}\\) over any time scale is normally distrubuted, and that returns over disjoint time periods are independent: wrong and wronger. For the purposes the option pricing, the most important feature of the GBM price process \\(S_{t}\\) is it’s volatility, which is typically denoted \\(\\sigma\\). Volatility is the standard-devation of the log-returns over one unit of time (the industry standard is to quote \\(\\sigma\\) for one year). Great news: Yuchen has been promoted to Wolverine’s option’s desk and his best customer Yefei has upgraded from forwards to buying call options on SPY. Let’s suppos that Yuchen and Yefei live in a Black-Scholes world. Yefie is in the market for a call option, and reaches out to Yuchen to try to get a deal done. Yuchen predicts that the volatility of SPY will be \\(\\sigma_{*}\\) over the life of the option, for which BSM gives a price of \\(P_{*}\\). Yuchen sells Yefei the call option - charging \\(P_{*}\\) - and then engages in dynamic delta-hedging. He rebalances his delta daily. Suppose that the realized volatilty of SPY during the life of the option is \\(\\sigma_{r}\\) and that the BSM price for that volatility would have been \\(P_{r}\\). They Yuchen’s PNL will be approximately: \\[\\begin{align*} P_{*} - P_{r} = V * (\\sigma_{*} - \\sigma_{r}) \\end{align*}\\] where \\(V\\) is the vega of the option. This is PNL is approximate because of discrete daily delta-hedging. If Yuchen delta-hedged continuously, as BSM prescribes, this PNL would be exact and deterministic. Notice that Yuchen’s PNL is a function of the difference between his pricing volaililty (implied) and the realized volatility. One of the major insights of the BSM framework is that a delta-hedged option position is a position in realized volatility. Intuition: an option price function has positive curvature (gamma). By delta hedging, you are removing the linear part of the option price changes, but there are still the second-order effects of changes in the price of the underlying. If you have a short delta-hedged option position, then your delta-hedging will often have you buying high and selling low. Not good. Facts about Delta-Hedged Options Positions: Consider a call and put with the same underlying, strike, and expiration. Then the delta-hedged call is equivalent to the delta-hedged put. The PNL of a naked option position will have a higher variance than the PNL of it’s delta-hedged counterpart. But the PNL variance of the delta-hedged position is not zero. A long delta-hedged option position is long realized volatility. A short delta-hedged option position is short realized volatility. 6.5 Greeks Here are some observations based on these graphs: Optionality - as evidenced by extrinsic value vega, theta, gamma - is greatest when options are ATM. Theta is Negative: an option loses value as it nears expiration. Vega is Positive: the more volatile the underlying, the more valuable the option. Regarding Delta: Approximiately 0.50 when option is ATM. Approaches 0.00 as option gets farther out of the money. Approaches 1.00 as option goes farther in the money. VERY roughly the probability that the option expires ITM. Used to refer to the moniness of an option. "]
