["option-intuition.html", "Chapter 1 Option Intuition 1.1 Car Insurance", " Chapter 1 Option Intuition Options are simple contracts that show up everywhere in finance. They can be viewed as the building block of many other financial instruments. The theory of option pricing lies at the foundation of much of quantitative finance. Options are insurance contracts wrapped around other financial assets. The asset that is being insured is called the underlying. The underlyings we are going to consider in this book will be stocks and ETFs, but the essential concepts are the same for other underlyings such as interest rates, corn futures, or barrels of oil. Let’s build some intuition by considering a type of insurance that you are probably familiar with: car insurance. 1.1 Car Insurance Wolverine Trading is a successful market-making firm based in Chicago. Following the lead of billionaire Warren Buffet, the partners at Wolverine are interest in getting into the car insurance business, and they have hired us as consultants to help devise a pricing policy for this business. The type of underlying that Wolverine would like to insure is: a specific driver coupled with a specific vehicle. The driver that is being insured is going to pay Wolverine premium. In exchange for the premium, Wolve will reimburse the driver whenever damage to the care exceeds a certain dollar amount, called the strike of the contract. Intuition Check: Do you think that Wolverine should charge the same premium irrespective of the underlying? Why or why not? After some deliberation, we have arrive upon the following underlying characteristic to base price differentiation on. Price of Underlying Sandra is a prospective customer; she has two vehicles that she wants to switch over. One is a busted old Mazda 3 that she bought when she was a struggling graduate student. The other is a fancy self-driving Tesla she bought after starting her lucrative options trading career. -ADD SIDE BY SIDE PICTURES HERE- Intuition Check: Which car should be more expensive to insure? Why? Strike Price of Contract Wolverine has three different strike prices that they can offer Sandra Tesla: at-the-money \\(:=\\) $0 $1,000 $5,000 Exercise: Order the premium for the three strike prices from cheapest to most expensive. Time to Expiration Wolve has three different strike prices they can offer to Sandra for her Tesla: 0.25 years 0.50 years 1.00 years Exercise: Order the premium for the three tenors from cheapest to most expensive. Voltility of Underlying Wolve is pricing insurance for two different customers, Sally and Patty. Both are looking to purchase insurance a fancy new self-driving Tesla. They both want a 1-year contract with with a $1,000 strike price. Sally’s friends describe her as calm, chill, responsible, quiet, serene. On the other hand, Patty’s friends describe her: wild, hyper, flakey, loud, and volatile. Intuition Check: Who should Wolverine charge more for insurance? Why? "],

For a more detailed treatment, I recommend the following execellent texts: Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives by John C. Hull Derivative Markets by Robert L. McDonald 2.1 Stocks &amp; Dividends Companies can raid funds to grow their business by issuing shares of stock. The buyer of the stock - often called a shareholder - pays money to the comapany which the company keeps forever. In return, the shareholder is entitled to a fraction of the companies future profits and also has the ability to vote on certain matters at shareholder meetings. A crucial point is that the owner of a stock has limited liability with resepct to the company. The worst thing that can happen is that shareholder never recieves any profits, and the stock itself also becomes worthless. So, for example, if the company is caught illegally polluting, the shareholder cannot be sued for damages. In this sense the value of stock can never be negative. Once a stock has been issued by a company, the owner of the stock can sell it to another invester. This is called a secondary market transaction. Once the share has been sold in the secondary market, the claims to profits and the voting rights are both transfered to the purchaser. Secondary market transactions occur on exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange, and are usually what people are referring to when they talk about the stock market. These transactions occur via complicated auction mechanisms that match buyers and sellers. The mechanisms are such that the actual trade prices can fluctuate (sometimes greatly) from transaction to transaction. Here are some example of companies who’s stocks trade heavily in the secondary markets. AAPL - Apple (you seriously have an Android bro) GOOG - Alphabet (dude iPhones are totally overrated) FB - Facebook (please like my pictures and make me feel cool) XOM - Exxon Mobile (I’m self-righteous about the environment…until I check my 401K) Suppose you want to trade a share of stock, and you want to be able to fill your trade immediately. If you are a buyer of the stock, you will be charged a certain amount called the ask price. If you are a seller of the stock you will recieve a certain amount called the bid price. The bid price is lower than the ask price. These so-called bid-ask spreads exist in other financial markets as well, including options markets. If you are a market for a particular stock, there are three prices that you will surely need to keep your eye one. The current bid price, the current ask price, and the last price at which a trade occurred. We will often refer to the price of a stock at time \\(t\\) and denote by \\(S_{t}\\). We can ofen gloss over what the phrase the price of the stock exactly means, you can safely choose to interpret it in one of two way: 1) the current mid price, which is as the average of the bid and ask at time \\(t\\); 2) the last trade price as of time \\(t\\). For stocks that have high trading volume, these two values will be usually quite close - but this is not always the case. The upshot of our previous discussion about exchanges is that \\(S_{t}\\) varies through time. As it turns out, it is useful to think of the of \\(S_{t}\\) as a series of random variable. In fancy math circles this is know as a stochastic process. It is my intention to try to avoid the nerdery of fancy math as much as possible, but sometimes we will be forced to indulge is such evils. My apologies in advanced. When profits are distributed to the owners of a stock, this is done on a per share basis. The amount that is paid per share is called a dividend payment. It is reasonable to wonder whether issuing a dividend payment has any near-term impact on the price of the stock. This question leads to our first qunatitative result. Theorem: Suppose that a stock is going make a divided payment of \\(c\\) at time \\(T\\) and that just prior to the dividend payment is trading at a price of \\(S^{*}\\). Then then price of the stock just after the divident payment is \\(S_{T} = S^{*} - c\\). Properly defining the concept of a share of stock is a complicated legal exercise. Similarly, an accurate description of how stocks are sold in the secondary market would require it’s own large (and boring) book. The amount of detail you will depend on your use-case. For example, if you are an attorney that works on IPOs, you will need to know a lot about the legal stuff. If you are a creating statistical arbitrage strategies, you will need be an expert on exchange microstructure. For the purposes of this book, the following stylized facts will suffice. Stocks give their claims to the companies profits. This is a limited liability investment in that the value of a stock can never be negative. After their initial issuance, Share of stock can be in the secondary market. Trading of stocks on the secondary market occurs on exchanges, with trades occurring thousands or millions of times a day during business hours. The exchange creates complex auction mechanisms to match buyers and seller. The rules are such that trades can occur and different prices for every transaction. The stream of trade prices is often denoted as \\(S_{t}\\) can be conceptualized as a stochastic process. Profits are paid out to shareholders in the form of a per-share payment called a dividend. Immediately after the payment of a dividend, the stock price will reduce by the amount of the dividend. 2.2 Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Investing in stocks and other assets is usually an overly costly and complex proposition for an individual. For this reason, there are various vehicles for small investors to pool their money, and for it to then be invested under the auspices of invmentment professionals. The most common for of investment pooling is a mutual fund. More esoteric manifestations are hedge funds, unit invesment trust (UIT), and real estate investment trusts (REIT). The distinction between these is of general interest, but won’t be of huge importance to us in this book. A fairly recent innovation in the world of pooled invesments is exchange traded funds (ETFs). Relative to mutual funds and hedge funds, ETFs engage in simpler strategies that are easier to execute. For this reason, it take fewer people to manage the fund and costs are low. In additon, sharte of ETFs are traded on exchanges in the exact same way as share of stock. ETFs also pay dividends in the same way that stocks do. Here are some popular ETFs: SPY - SPDR SP500 - tracks the S&amp;P500. IWM - iShares Russell 2000. GLD - invests in gold future. XLF - SPDR Financial - tracks the performance of financial services sector. For the purpose of this course, we will treat stocks and ETFs as largely the same. 2.3 Discounting &amp; Accumulating When you lend money, you are paid interest to compensate for the fact that you can’t use the money to lent for other purposes. In this book I assume loans are totally safe and there is no risk of default. It is useful to the of the loan amount accumulating with interest. I use the following notation and nomenclature to capture this idea of accumulation: Definition: Assume the current time is \\(t\\) and that \\(T\\) is some time in the future. Then one dollar will accumulate to \\(A(t,T)\\) by time \\(T\\). I will call \\(A(t,T)\\) an accumulation factor. If you are going to recieve money in the future, it’s not really worth as much to you as if the money were paid right now. The way we account for this value difference is by essentially discounting by the amount of interest you could have earned between now when you are going to be paid. The is the notion of present value and I express it as follows: Definition: The time \\(t\\) present value of a one dollar cashflow at time \\(T\\) will be denoted by \\(D(t,T)\\). I will call \\(D(t,T)\\) a discount factor. I will call \\(D(t, T)\\) a discount factor. The following statements are true: \\(A(t,T) \\geq 1\\). \\(D(t, T) \\leq 1\\). \\(D(t,T) = A(t,T)^{-1}\\). Definition: Suppose the current time is \\(t\\) and consider a series of cashflows \\(C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{n}\\) occurring at future times \\(t_{1}, \\ldots t_{n}\\). Then the time \\(t\\) present value of this stream of cashflows is defined as: \\[\\begin{align*} PV(\\{ C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{n} \\}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} D(t, t_{i}) \\cdot C_{i}. \\end{align*}\\] 2.4 Forward Contracts Forward contracts are simple derivatives that are one of the foundational building blocks in the theory and practice of quantitative finance. The value of forwards are related to option prices via a result known as put-call parity, a finding seminal to much of derivatives theory. 2.4.1 Specification and Payoff A forward contract this the obligation to transact some underlying asset at some future date, at a fixed price, called the strike price. The party that agrees to buy the underlying, is called the long side; the party that agrees to sell the underlying is the short side. The underlyings we will consider in this book will be stocks or ETFs, but forwards can exist on any kind of underlying: gold, corn, etc. The key feature of a forward is that both sides are obligated to execute their side of the transaction - to either buy our sell the asset, at the agreed upon strike price. This stands in contrast to an option, in which the long side has a right, while the short side has an obligation. Suppose a forward contract struck at \\(K\\) expires at time \\(T\\). Suppose that underlying is trading at \\(S_{T}\\) at the time of expiration. The long side has to pay \\(K\\) and in return receives the underlying which has a value of \\(S_{T}\\). Thus the long position is worth \\(S_{T} - K\\) at expiration. On the other hand, the short side recieves \\(K\\) but has to deliver the underlying, which is worth \\(S_{T}\\). So the short position is worth \\(K - S_{T}\\). Long Payoff: \\(S_{T} - K\\) Short Payoff: \\(S_{T} - K\\) 2.4.2 The Forward Price Suppose that the current time is \\(t\\) and that we are considering a forward contract that expires at time \\(T\\). Suppose further that the underlying is currently trading at \\(S_{t}\\). We are interested in the following questions: is there strike price of \\(K\\) such that both parties can enter into the forward contract for zero cost, without introducing an arbitrage opportunity for either side? It turns out the answer is yes, an this strike price is of such importance that it has been named simply, the forward price. A forward price is determined by two points in time: the current time \\(t\\) and the expiration time \\(T\\). We will denote the forward price associated with these two times as \\(F(t, T)\\). Forward Pricing Formula: Suppose we are considering a forward contract at time \\(t\\) which expires at time \\(T\\). Suppose that the underlying is currently trading at \\(S_{t}\\) and that during the life of the forward, the underlying stock pays dividends \\(c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\) at times \\(t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{n}\\). Then the we have that: \\[\\begin{align*} F(t, T) &amp;= A(t, T) \\cdot S_{t} - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} A(t, t_{i}, T) \\cdot c_{i} \\end{align*}\\] In words we have that the forward price is the accumulated value of the current stock price less the accumulated value of all the dividend payments during the life of the contract. Notice that for non-dividend paying stocks we have that: \\(F(t, T) = A(t, T) \\cdot S_{t}\\). 2.4.3 Valuing a Forward Contract Suppose that you enter into a forward contract at time \\(t^{*}\\) and the strike price \\(K\\) was chosen such that both parties could enter into the contract for zero cost. Suppose that the time is now \\(t &gt; t^{*}\\), what would be the value to unwind this contract? Fact: The no arbitrage unwind value of this contract is \\(D(t, T) \\cdot (F(t, T) - K)\\). This result really has nothing to do with the fact that the forward contract entered into at time \\(t^{*}\\) or that it’s initial strike what chosen to make it a zero value contract. Ultimately it just gives us a formula for valuing a forward contract at any point. Notice that if a forward contract is struck at the current forward price, then it has zero value, which we would expect. 2.4.4 Synthetic Forwards A portfolio consisting of a long call and a short put is a synthetic forward position. Let the current time be \\(t\\). Consider a call and put on the same underlying, with the same strike price \\(K\\), that both expire at time \\(T\\). If you have a long position in the call and a short position in the put, then in all states of the world at time \\(T\\) this portfolio has a value of \\(S_{T} - K\\), which is the same value as the payoff as a long forward. Suppose that \\(S_{T} &gt; K\\). You exercise your long call, for which you recieve the stock worth \\(S_{T}\\) whilie paying the strike price \\(K\\) for it. The put you are short expires worthless. The total value of these two positions is \\(S_{T} - K\\). On the other hand, suppose \\(S_{T} &lt; K\\). Your short put postion will be exercised, forcing you to buy the stock for \\(K\\) even though it is only worth \\(S_{T}\\). Your call is worthless, so you won’t exercise. Once again, the combined value of these two position is \\(S_{T} - K\\). If \\(S_{T} = K\\), nothing happens because both options are worthless. Doing nothing has zero value. But of course in this situation we have that \\(S_{T} - K = 0\\). 2.5 Put-Call Parity Let the current time be \\(t\\) and consider a put and a call that both expire at time \\(T\\) and that are both struck at \\(K\\). From the previous section we know that a long call and a short put create a synthetic forward struck at \\(K\\). We also know how to value any forward contract. Putting these two results together we get following put-call parity identity. \\[\\begin{align*} C(t, T, K) - P(t, T, K) = D(t, T) \\cdot (F(t, T) - K) \\end{align*}\\] Put-call parity is one of the most important and foundational results in all of derivatives theory. 2.5.1 Non-Dividend Paying Stock Recall that when the stock pays no dividends during the life of the forward, that the forward price is simply the accumulated spot price. \\[\\begin{align*} C(t, T, K) - P(t, T, K) &amp;= D(t, T) \\cdot (F(t, T) - K) \\\\ &amp;= D(t, T) \\cdot (A(t, T) \\cdot S_{t} - K) \\\\ &amp;= S_{t} - D(t, T) \\cdot K \\end{align*}\\] 2.5.2 Dividend Paying Stock Suppose that during the life of the options, that the underlying stockpays dividends \\(c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{n}\\) at times \\(t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{n}\\). \\[\\begin{align*} C(t, T, K) - P(t, T, K) &amp;= D(t, T) \\cdot (F(t, T) - K) \\\\ &amp;= D(t, T) \\cdot \\bigg(A(t, T) \\cdot S_{t} - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} A(t, t_{i}, T) \\cdot c_{i} - K \\bigg) \\\\ &amp;= S_{t} - PV(\\{c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{n} \\}) - D(t, T) \\cdot K \\end{align*}\\] 2.6 American "]
