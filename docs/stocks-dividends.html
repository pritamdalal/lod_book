<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Stocks &amp; Dividends</h2>
<p>Companies can raid funds to grow their business by issuing <em>shares of stock</em>. The buyer of the stock - often called a shareholder - pays money to the comapany which the company keeps forever. In return, the shareholder is entitled to a fraction of the companies future profits and also has the ability to vote on certain matters at shareholder meetings. A crucial point is that the owner of a stock has limited liability with resepct to the company. The worst thing that can happen is that shareholder never recieves any profits, and the stock itself also becomes worthless. So, for example, if the company is caught illegally polluting, the shareholder cannot be sued for damages. In this sense the value of stock can never be negative.</p>
<p>Once a stock has been issued by a company, the owner of the stock can sell it to another invester. This is called a secondary market transaction. Once the share has been sold in the secondary market, the claims to profits and the voting rights are both transfered to the purchaser.</p>
<p>Secondary market transactions occur on exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange, and are usually what people are referring to when they talk about <em>the stock market</em>. These transactions occur via complicated auction mechanisms that match buyers and sellers. The mechanisms are such that the actual trade prices can fluctuate (sometimes greatly) from transaction to transaction.</p>
<p>Here are some example of companies who’s stocks trade heavily in the secondary markets.</p>
<p><strong>AAPL</strong> - Apple (you seriously have an Android bro)</p>
<p><strong>GOOG</strong> - Alphabet (dude iPhones are totally overrated)</p>
<p><strong>FB</strong> - Facebook (please like my pictures and make me feel cool)</p>
<p><strong>XOM</strong> - Exxon Mobile (I’m self-righteous about the environment…until I check my 401K)</p>
<p>Suppose you want to trade a share of stock, and you want to be able to fill your trade immediately. If you are a buyer of the stock, you will be charged a certain amount called the ask price. If you are a seller of the stock you will recieve a certain amount called the bid price. The bid price is lower than the ask price. These so-called <em>bid-ask spreads</em> exist in other financial markets as well, including options markets.</p>
<p>If you are a market for a particular stock, there are three prices that you will surely need to keep your eye one. The current bid price, the current ask price, and the last price at which a trade occurred. We will often refer to <em>the price of a stock at time</em> <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and denote by <span class="math inline">\(S_{t}\)</span>. We can ofen gloss over what the phrase <em>the price of the stock</em> exactly means, you can safely choose to interpret it in one of two way: 1) the current mid price, which is as the average of the bid and ask at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>; 2) the last trade price as of time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. For stocks that have high trading volume, these two values will be usually quite close - but this is not always the case.</p>
<p>The upshot of our previous discussion about exchanges is that <span class="math inline">\(S_{t}\)</span> varies through time. As it turns out, it is useful to think of the of <span class="math inline">\(S_{t}\)</span> as a series of random variable. In fancy math circles this is know as a <em>stochastic process</em>. It is my intention to try to avoid the nerdery of fancy math as much as possible, but sometimes we will be forced to indulge is such evils. My apologies in advanced.</p>
<p>When profits are distributed to the owners of a stock, this is done on a per share basis. The amount that is paid per share is called a <em>dividend payment</em>. It is reasonable to wonder whether issuing a dividend payment has any near-term impact on the price of the stock. This question leads to our first <em>qunatitative</em> result.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Suppose that a stock is going make a divided payment of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and that just prior to the dividend payment is trading at a price of <span class="math inline">\(S^{*}\)</span>. Then then price of the stock just after the divident payment is <span class="math inline">\(S_{T} = S^{*} - c\)</span>.</p>
<p>Properly defining the concept of a share of <em>stock</em> is a complicated legal exercise. Similarly, an accurate description of how stocks are sold in the secondary market would require it’s own large (and boring) book. The amount of detail you will depend on your use-case. For example, if you are an attorney that works on IPOs, you will need to know a lot about the legal stuff. If you are a creating statistical arbitrage strategies, you will need be an expert on exchange microstructure.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this book, the following stylized facts will suffice.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Stocks give their claims to the companies profits. This is a limited liability investment in that the value of a stock can never be negative.</p></li>
<li><p>After their initial issuance, Share of stock can be in the secondary market.</p></li>
<li><p>Trading of stocks on the secondary market occurs on exchanges, with trades occurring thousands or millions of times a day during business hours.</p></li>
<li><p>The exchange creates complex auction mechanisms to match buyers and seller. The rules are such that trades can occur and different prices for every transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>The stream of trade prices is often denoted as <span class="math inline">\(S_{t}\)</span> can be conceptualized as a stochastic process.</p></li>
<li><p>Profits are paid out to shareholders in the form of a per-share payment called a dividend. Immediately after the payment of a dividend, the stock price will reduce by the amount of the dividend.</p></li>
