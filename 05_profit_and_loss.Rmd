# Profit & Loss

The most basic and important performance measure of a trading strategy is its daily *profit and loss*, which we usually shorten to simply *PNL*.  In subsequent chapters, we will encounter a variety of theoretical statements regarding the pricing and hedging of options; many of these can be easily translated into statements about PNL.  It is my opinion that analyzing PNLs is the best way to internalize knowledge of options, which is in part why I wrote this book.

In this chapter we consider how to calculate profit and loss for stocks and options trades.

## Stock PNL

## Option PNL
Suppose we trade an option $\mathcal{O}$ at a price $P$ on trade date $t_{1}$, and we hold that position until expiration, which is trade date $t_{n}$.  The letter $i$ will serve as an index over the trade dates, so $i = 1,\ldots,n$. 

Let $B_{i}$ and $A_{i}$ be the end-of-day bid and ask prices of the option for trade date $t_{i}$. Note that both $B_{n}$ and $A_{n}$ are equal to the option payoff.  We seek to define the following:  

**Daily:** $D_{i}$ -  the *daily PNL* for the trade as of end-of-day $t_i$.  

**TTD:** $C_{i}$ - the *trade-to-date PNL* for the trade as of end-of-day $t_i$.

Intuitively, the trade-to-date (TTD) PNL is the amount of money you made or lost if you unwind the trade at current market values.  The daily PNL is the one day change in the trade-to-date PNL.  The two concepts are interchangeable in that it is possible to define TTD PNL in terms of daily PNL, and vice versa.

In my own work, I prefer to calculate daily PNLs for a trade, and then define the trade-to-date PNL as the sum of the previous daily PNLs.  We will consider both alternatives below.  It is useful to consider buys and sells separately.

#### TTD as Sum of Daily - Buy {-}


\begin{align*}
D_{i} &= \begin{cases} B_{1} - P & i = 1 \\ B_{i} - B_{i-1} & i > 1 \end{cases} \\[10pt]
C_{i} &= \sum_{k=1}^{i} D_{k}
\end{align*}

&nbsp;

**Exercise:** Show that $C_{j} = B_{j} - P$. 


#### TTD as Sum of Daily - Sell {-}


\begin{align*}
D_{i} &= \begin{cases} P - A_{1} & i = 1 \\ A_{i-1} - A_{i} & i > 1 \end{cases} \\[10pt]
C_{i} &= \sum_{k=1}^{i} D_{k}
\end{align*}

&nbsp;

**Exercise:** Show that $C_{i} = P - A_{i}$. 


#### Daily as Change in TTD - Buy {-}


\begin{align*}
C_{i} &= B_{i} - P \\[10pt]
D_{i} &= \begin{cases} C_{1} & i = 1 \\ C_{i} - C_{i-1} & i > 1 \end{cases}
\end{align*}

&nbsp;

**Exercise:** Show that both formulations of $D_{i}$ are equivalent.


#### Daily as Change in TTD - Sell {-}


\begin{align*}
C_{i} &= P - A_{i} \\[10pt]
D_{i} &= \begin{cases} C_{1} & i = 1 \\ C_{i} - C_{i-1} & i > 1 \end{cases}
\end{align*}

&nbsp;

**Exercise:** Show that both formulations of $D_{i}$ are equivalent.

## Scaling Up
In a professional setting, it is rare that you will calculate the PNL of a single stock trade or options trade. Rather, you will want to calculate the PNL of a portfolio of trades.  Conceptually this is quite simple, as the daily PNL of a collection of trades is simply the sum of the daily PNL of the individual trades.  In practice, for large numbers of trades, you have to be careful because unforseen errors - say from missing data, or an erroneous price - can be hard to identify.

## Returns

While PNL is an important performance metric, it is often hard to interpret without first normalizing by the amount of capital required to fund the investment.  This is precisely what the notion of a return is.
