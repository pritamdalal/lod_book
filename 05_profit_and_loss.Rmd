# Profit & Loss
The most basic performance measure of a particular trade is its daily *profit and loss*, usually shortened to *PNL*.  In essence, daily pnl measures how much the trade increased or decreased in value on a particular day?  We will also be interested in *cummualative PNL* - also know as *trade-to-date (TTD) PNL* - which measures the total amount a trade has increased or decreased in value since its inception.


In subsequent chapters, we will encounter a variety of theoretical statements regarding the pricing and hedging of options; many of these can be easily translated into statements about PNL.  

<!-- It is my opinion that analyzing PNLs is the best way to internalize knowledge of options, which is in part why I wrote this book. -->

In this chapter we explore how to calculate profit and loss for trades on options and stock.

## Stock PNL
As mentioned in the *Quantitative Results* chapter, after a stock has been issued, it can be traded in the secondary market.  These trades occur on various exchanges, throughout the day, on most business days.  The stocks that you are familiar with (GOOG, AAPL, FB) trade tens of thousands of times a day, with millions of shares transacted daily.

For a given trading day, the final trade price of a stock is referred to as the *close* price.  The series of close prices of a stock give information about the performace of the stock as an investement.  

Daily close prices will be relevant to us for two reasons:

1. The payoff of an equity option is determined by the close price of its underlying on the option expiration date.

1. Close prices are used to determine the daily PNL of a stock position.

In this section we will concern ourselves with #2.



### The Notation the Trade
Half the battle in discussing PNL rigorously is setting up the notation. 


Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a particular stock, and let $t_i, \ldots t_n$ be consecutive trading days.  Suppose that we purchase one share of stock in the middle of of the day on $t_i$, for a purchase price of $S^o$.  Suppose further that we hold that share until day $t_n$, at which time we sell it for $S^c$.


We seek to define the following:  

**Daily:** $D_{i}$ -  the *daily PNL* for the trade as of end-of-day $t_i$.  

**TTD:** $C_{i}$ - the *trade-to-date PNL* for the trade as of end-of-day $t_i$.

In words, the daily PNL of our single share purchase is simply the dollar change in the price of the stock.  The cummulative PNL is the sum of the daily PNLs.


### Marking to Mid
 <!-- Suppose we purchase one share of it in the middle of the day $t_1$, and that the trade price is $S^{*}$.  Now, let $S_{t_i}$ be the settle price for day $i=1,\ldots,n$.   -->

\begin{align*}
D_{i} &= \begin{cases} S_{1} - S^{o}, & i = 1 \\ S_{i} - S_{i-1}, & 1 < i < n \\ S^{c} - S_{n-1}, & i = n\end{cases} \\[10pt]
C_{i} &= \sum_{k=1}^{i} D_{k}
\end{align*}


The fact that $C_{i} = S_{i} - S^{*}$ can be interpreted as the following intuitive statement: the stock purchase is worth the difference between its current price and the price we paid for it.

The tacit assumption of this simple calculation is that if we unwind our position, we would do so at the *mid* price.  However, this isn't quite true in practice.  Depending on your application and the availability of the data, you may want to incorporate the fact that you would have to unwind at the bid.  This is what we will do in the next section.


### Marking to Bid
Suppose now that instead of a single end of day price, that our data set tells us both the bid price and thd ask price, denoted $B_{i}$ and $A_{i}$.

If we want to *mark* our stock trade to the bid, then we would need to modify the definiton of our daily and cumulative PNL as follows:

\begin{align*}
D_{i} &= \begin{cases} B_{1} - S^{*} & i = 1 \\ B_{i} - B_{i-1} & i > 1 \end{cases} \\[10pt]
C_{i} &= \sum_{k=1}^{i} D_{k} = B_{i} - S^{*}
\end{align*}

By marking to the bid, we are accounting for the fact that if we were to exit our long stock position, we would sell the stock, and we would have to sell the stock at the bid.  

This type of If you are analyzing a trading system the involves frequent opening and closing of positions, then it is important to account for bids and asks in your PNL calcuations.


## Option PNL

Suppose we trade an option $\mathcal{O}$ at a price $P$ on trade date $t_{1}$, and we hold that position until expiration, which is trade date $t_{n}$.  The letter $i$ will serve as an index over the trade dates, so $i = 1,\ldots,n$. 

Let $B_{i}$ and $A_{i}$ be the end-of-day bid and ask prices of the option for trade date $t_{i}$. Note that both $B_{n}$ and $A_{n}$ are equal to the option payoff.  We seek to define the following:  

**Daily:** $D_{i}$ -  the *daily PNL* for the trade as of end-of-day $t_i$.  

**TTD:** $C_{i}$ - the *trade-to-date PNL* for the trade as of end-of-day $t_i$.

Intuitively, the trade-to-date (TTD) PNL is the amount of money you made or lost if you unwind the trade at current market values.  The daily PNL is the one day change in the trade-to-date PNL.  The two concepts are interchangeable in that it is possible to define TTD PNL in terms of daily PNL, and vice versa.

In my own work, I prefer to calculate daily PNLs for a trade, and then define the trade-to-date PNL as the sum of the previous daily PNLs.  We will consider both alternatives below.  It is useful to consider buys and sells separately.

### Total PNL At Expiration
The easiest PNL concept for an option trade is the the total PNL at the time of expiration.

Suppose option $\mathcal{O}$ at a price $P$ on trade date $t_{1}$, and we hold that position until expiration, which is trade date $t_{n}$.  Let $\Pi$ be the payoff of the option.  Then at the time of expiration, the total PNLs for for the long and shorts positions2 are as follows:


Long: $\Pi - P$

Short: $P - \Pi$



#### TTD as Sum of Daily - Buy {-}


\begin{align*}
D_{i} &= \begin{cases} B_{1} - P & i = 1 \\ B_{i} - B_{i-1} & i > 1 \end{cases} \\[10pt]
C_{i} &= \sum_{k=1}^{i} D_{k}
\end{align*}

&nbsp;

**Exercise:** Show that $C_{j} = B_{j} - P$. 


#### TTD as Sum of Daily - Sell {-}


\begin{align*}
D_{i} &= \begin{cases} P - A_{1} & i = 1 \\ A_{i-1} - A_{i} & i > 1 \end{cases} \\[10pt]
C_{i} &= \sum_{k=1}^{i} D_{k}
\end{align*}

&nbsp;

**Exercise:** Show that $C_{i} = P - A_{i}$. 


#### Daily as Change in TTD - Buy {-}


\begin{align*}
C_{i} &= B_{i} - P \\[10pt]
D_{i} &= \begin{cases} C_{1} & i = 1 \\ C_{i} - C_{i-1} & i > 1 \end{cases}
\end{align*}

&nbsp;

**Exercise:** Show that both formulations of $D_{i}$ are equivalent.

\end{align*}

&nbsp;

**Exercise:** Show that both formulations of $D_{i}$ are equivalent.

## Scaling Up
In a professional setting, it is rare that you will calculate the PNL of a single stock trade or options trade. Rather, you will want to calculate the PNL of a portfolio of trades.  Conceptually this is quite simple, as the daily PNL of a collection of trades is simply the sum of the daily PNL of the individual trades.  In practice, for large numbers of trades, you have to be careful because unforseen errors - say from missing data, or an erroneous price - can be hard to identify.

## Returns

While PNL is an important performance metric, it is often hard to interpret without first normalizing by the amount of capital required to fund the investment.  This is precisely what the notion of a return is.  

<!-- We will let $R_{i}$ be the day $t_{i}$ be the return of a trading strategy -->
