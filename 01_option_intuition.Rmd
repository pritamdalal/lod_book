# Option Intuition

Options are simple contracts that show up everywhere in finance.  They can be viewed as the building block of many other financial instruments.  The theory of option pricing lies at the foundation of much of quantitative finance.

Options are insurance contracts wrapped around other financial assets.  The asset that is being insured is called the *underlying*.  The underlyings we are going to consider in this book will be stocks and ETFs, but the essential concepts are the same for other underlyings such as interest rates, corn futures, or barrels of oil.

Let's build some intuition by considering a type of insurance that you are probably familiar with: car insurance.


## Car Insurance

Wolverine Trading is a successful market-making firm based in Chicago. Following the lead of billionaire Warren Buffet, the partners at Wolverine are interest in getting into the car insurance business, and they have hired us as consultants to help devise a pricing policy for this business.


The type of underlying that Wolverine would like to insure is: a specific driver coupled with a specific vehicle.  The driver that is being insured is going to pay Wolverine *premium*.  In exchange for the premium, Wolve will reimburse the driver whenever damage to the care exceeds a certain dollar amount, called the *strike* of the contract.


**Intuition Check:** Do you think that Wolverine should charge the same premium irrespective of the underlying?  Why or why not?

After some deliberation, we have arrive upon the following underlying characteristic to base price differentiation on.

#### **Price of Underlying** {-}

Sandra is a prospective customer; she has two vehicles that she wants to switch over.   One is a busted old Mazda 3 that she bought when she was a struggling graduate student.  The other is a fancy self-driving Tesla she bought after starting her lucrative options trading career.

Wolverine has three different strike prices that they can offer Sandra Tesla:

  - \$5,000


**Exercise:** Order the premium for the three strike prices from cheapest to most expensive.


#### **Time to Expiration** {-}

Wolve has three different strike prices they can offer to Sandra for her Tesla:

  - 0.25 years
  - 0.50 years
  - 1.00 years

**Exercise:** Order the premium for the three tenors from cheapest to most expensive.


#### **Voltility of Underlying** {-}

Wolve is pricing insurance for two different customers, Sally and Patty. Both are looking to purchase insurance a fancy new self-driving Tesla.   They both want a 1-year contract with with a $1,000 strike price.  Sally's friends describe her as calm, chill, responsible, quiet, serene.  On the other hand, Patty's friends describe her: wild, hyper, flakey, loud, and **volatile**.
